A marked transition from their first release, EP2 shows them expand on their original formula. The EP explodes out of the gate with the full-on electronic heavy rock of &quot;Shouting 'Fire!' in a Crowded Theatre&quot;, flowing through other tracks which include far-ranging influences from folk, blues, alternative rock and electro.\n\nRecorded during the British bands stay in America, EP2 focused on creating a cohesive sense of travel by utilising soundbites from street sellers in New York City to wandering through the woodlands of Lake Crabtree in North Carolina.\ncredits\n\n\n    released 18 June 2011\n    Credits -\n\n    Dave Larkin - vocals, bass guitar, arrangements, autoharp, producing, lyrics, drum arrangements, synths, tamborine\n\n    Tom Hackwell - vocals, guitar (12 string, acoustic, electric), viola, string arrangements, producing, lyrics, producing\n\n    All songs written by Larkin, Hackwell with the exceptions of track 3 (traditional) and track 4 written by Larkin, Hackwell and Galdy.\n\n    Dave Bunn - drums (track 1)\n    Lukas Barry - drums (track 4)\n    Gillian Galdy - vocals (track 4)\n\n    Guest 'gang' vocals on Sleepimage - Dave Bunn, Tina Lutfy, Will Tallman, Andrew Blackley, Carigan Chastain, Mike and James, Justin Dunlap, Natalie 'Bill' Scalisi\n\n    Thanks to - Justin Dunlap (for lending us a mixer, autoharp, tamborine, and various other things), Sam Clifford (for lending us another mixer), Dane Taylor (for lending us drum mics), Dave Bunn (for letting us sample his kit and giving us a space to make noise in), Stephen Cerasoli (for lending us a nice 12 string Martin), Lukas Barry (for letting us sample his kit, giving us another space to make noise in and for learning drum parts really fast)\n\n    Cover design by Abi Ponton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5703463002a832ebb3609fef542bc5dda39146de","amp;dn":"Armchair+Committee+-+EP2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5703463002a832ebb3609fef542bc5dda39146de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,3,70,48,2,168,50,235,179,96,159,239,84,43,197,221,163,145,70,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
