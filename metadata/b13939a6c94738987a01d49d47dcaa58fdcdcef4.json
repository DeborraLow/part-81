Though premiering at a time when horror movies were in decline and plagued with an array of start up problems, Scream went on to shatter box-office records for horror films, earning well over $100 million in domestic box office receipts, revived Craven's career and turned first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson and a group of hot young television actors (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Rose McGowan) into overnight stars. The film became a huge success, spawned three sequels and single-handedly revived the horror genre. &quot;Scream: The Inside Story&quot; features all-new interviews with Wes Craven, Neve Campell, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan and Matthew Lillard along with the many other cast and crew.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13939a6c94738987a01d49d47dcaa58fdcdcef4","amp;dn":"Scream%3A+The+Inside+Story+%28720p+HDTV+rip%29+%5BPar-O-Dime%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13939a6c94738987a01d49d47dcaa58fdcdcef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,57,57,166,201,71,56,152,122,1,212,157,71,220,170,88,253,205,206,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
