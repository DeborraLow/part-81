That seems to be what the members of Ana Kefr want to be: excluded from all religions. This message is pushed strongly in their lyrics, which sometimes tend to come off as brazen as the message theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re preaching against. Still, their debut album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVolume 1,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a metal monster. Versatile and brutal, melodic and masterful, Ana Kefr has pulled out all the stops of their music writing ability for this beast of an album.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVolume 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the utter versatility the band has woven through the music. The album starts out with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChapter 1,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ an atmospheric instrumental track (I later discovered that the other four tracks with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChapterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in them all act as instrumental interludes; a nice touch) and dives straight into a venomous thrasher with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Day that Guilt Turned White.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The next track, with the very tongue-in-cheek title of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFeed a PETA Member to a Starving Child in Africa,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a 17 second grind track, akin to Napalm Death. From here on, this album is a vibrant display of countless sources of inspiration.\n\nWhether the band is thrashing, slamming out a chugging breakdown, tapping the bongos or beautifully keying a symphonic piano section, the music weaves its way throughout the songs beautifully. Groovy thrash riffs are a staple here, along with heavy metal leads and catchy clean vocal choruses. Besides these, the band incorporates a sort of Middle Eastern feel to some of their music, along with some hardcore punk influences mixed in. Even amongst all the diverse and creative things done on this album, the band always manages to pull the songs together into a graceful cohesion that makes their music masterful yet accessible. I think the best general term I can stick to Ana Kefr would be progressive death metal, but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVolume 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is so much more than that.\n\nFrom hearing some of the lyrics on this album, Ana Kefr obviously opposes religion in general. This is pretty standard in the metal industry, but some of the lyrical content on this album is very simplistic and makes the band seem more interested in ramming their message down the listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s throat than anything. Still, this album is full of great music. Unlike a lot of bands, Ana Kefr at least weaves their message into something very different and very creative, unlike a lot of monotonous black metal or skull thumping death metal.\n\nFor a debut album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVolume 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is pretty heavy material. The band members are obviously very experienced musicians and have woven together different influences into a rich, dense cohesion that is unlike a lot of recent releases I have heard. At the very end of the album, a strange vocal sample instructs the listener to insert volume two, so I have a feeling we havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t heard the last of these guys.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49d0615f1b6671fc3a31d9c59c623df39641876","amp;dn":"Ana+Kefr+-+Volume+1+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49d0615f1b6671fc3a31d9c59c623df39641876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,157,6,21,241,182,103,31,195,163,29,156,89,198,35,223,57,100,24,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
