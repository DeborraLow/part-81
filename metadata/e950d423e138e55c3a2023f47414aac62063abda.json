Jean Duhaime briefly surveys the history of these texts from their initial discovery to their official publication. He describes the different scrolls and gives details of their contents and their relationships to one another. Duhaime summarizes the various reasons supporting a dating of this composition to the Hellenistic or Roman period and provides an example of the use of the Bible in the War Texts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e950d423e138e55c3a2023f47414aac62063abda","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+The+War+Texts+1QM+and+related+manuscripts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e950d423e138e55c3a2023f47414aac62063abda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,80,212,35,225,56,229,92,58,32,35,244,116,20,170,198,32,99,171,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
