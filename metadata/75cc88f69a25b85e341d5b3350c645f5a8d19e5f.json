As always, there were a few bands that didn't give\npermission for their gigs to be broadcasted live through the mainstream (30 Seconds to Mars, Volbeat, Deadmau5 and several others)\nbut pretty much all performances are complete.\n\nOther then last year, two of the headliners could be watched live through the livestream, except for Coldplay, which is only\navailable in an one hour edit of their 1,5 hour performance.\n\nThere were some technical difficulties but the majority of those issues were due to the incompetence of the engineers of the public\nnetwork, of which Cultura is part from. Somewhat 'understandable', since the Dutch public network is facing some major budget cuts\nso the expensive and experienced engineers are being laid off and replaced by cheaper and inexperenced ones.\n\nOn my end, there were only two performances (Tim Knol and All Time Low) where the stream couldn't handle the weight, so they are the\nonly ones with a part 1 and a part 2.\n\n\nAll footage were taken from the livestream and the image quality is acceptable if you don't have any high definition expectations.\n\n\nVideo: 480x272/25fps\nAudio: Stereo @ 44.1 kHz/128Kb per second\n\n\nComplete performances:\n - All Time Low (devided in 2 parts) (Day 3)\n - Alter Bridge (Day 1)\n - Band of Horses (Day 3)\n - De Staat (Day 1)\n - Elbow (Day 1)\n - Foo Fighters (Headliner day 3)\n - Go Back to the Zoo (Day 3)\n - Grafitti6 Day 2)\n - Hurts (Day 2)\n - Justin Nozuka (Day 2)\n - Kaiser Chiefs (Day 3)\n - Kings of Leon (Headliner day 2)\n - Manic Street Preachers (Day 1)\n - Scouting for Girls (Day 3)\n - Simple Plan (Day 1)\n - The Gaslight Anthem (Day 3)\n - Tim Knol (devided in 2 parts) (Day 2)\n - Two Door Cinema Club (Day 3)\n - VersaEmerge (Day 2)\n - White Lies (Day 2)\n - Wolfmother (Day 2)\n\n\nHighlights:\n - Dazzled Kid (Day 3, last 30mins)\n - Coldplay (Headliner day 1, one hour edit of their 1,5 hour performance)\n\n\n\nTV Registrations\n================\n\nVideo: 480x384/25fps &amp; 512x384/25fpx (4:3 format, 16:9 letterboxed)\nAudio: Stereo @ 44.1 kHz/128Kb per second\n\n\nSaturday (101 mins) contains clips from (in order of apperance):\n\n - Coldplay (Headliner)\n - De Staat\n - Wolfmother\n - Grafitti6\n - Laura Jansen\n - Kings of Leon (Headliner)\n - White Lies\n - Tim Knol\n - Manic Street Preachers\n - Elbow\n - Lifehouse\n - Selah Sue\n - Hurts\n - Coldplay (Headliner)\n\nSunday (280 mins) contains clips from (in order of apperance):\n\n - Kaiser Chiefs\n - Dazzled Kid\n - Hanson\n - Laura Jansen\n - Kings of Leon\n - Elbow\n - Go Back to the Zoo\n - The Script\n - Elize Doolittle\n - Coldplay\n - Simple Plan\n - Tim Knol\n - Dutch block containing:\n   + De Staat\n   + Dazzled Kid\n   + Laura Jansen\n   + Go Back to the Zoo\n - Scouting for Girls\n - Two Door Cinema Club\n - Beatsteaks\n - Kaiser Chiefs (reprise)\n - Plain White T's\n - Band of Horses\n - All Time Low\n - Foo Fighters\n - The Gaslight Anthem\n - Hurts\n - Coldplay (reprise)\n - Kings of Leon (reprise)\n - Elize Doolittle (reprise)\n - Various 3-On-Stage sessions including:\n   + Grafitti6\n   + Eliza Doolittle\n   + Simple Plan\n   + Plain White T's\n   + De Staat\n   + Tim Knol\n   + Selah Sue\n   + Hanson\n   + Dave Grohl\n - Avenged Sevenfold\n - Wolfmother\n - The Gaslight Anthem (reprise)\n - The Bloody Beatroots - Death Crew 77\n - The Script (reprise)\n - Foo Fighters (reprise)\n - 50 minutes of highlights:\n   + Kings of Leon\n   + Plain White T's\n   + Dazzled Kid\n   + Wolfmother\n   + Manic Street Preachers\n   + Laura Jansen\n   + Elbow\n   + White Lies\n   + Hanson\n   + Two Door Cinema Club\n   + Hurts\n   + Coldplay\n   + Go Back to the Zoo\n   + Tim Knol\n   + Beatsteaks\n   + Kaiser Chiefs\n   + Dave Grohl (3-On-Stage session)\n   + The Gaslight Anthem\n   + Eliza Doolittle\n   + Band of Horses\n   + Foo Fighters\n\n\nHave fun  ;)\n\n\nMore info about Pinkpop: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkpop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75cc88f69a25b85e341d5b3350c645f5a8d19e5f","amp;dn":"Pinkpop+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75cc88f69a25b85e341d5b3350c645f5a8d19e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,204,136,246,154,37,184,94,52,29,91,51,80,198,69,245,168,209,158,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
