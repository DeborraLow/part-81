Rack, Shack, and Benny work in a factory that makes chocolate bunnies, owned by Nebbie K. Nezzer (a la King Nebecanezzer). His obsession with the bunnies leads him to build a giant one. Anyone who doesn't bow down and worship is fed to the furnace, where the &quot;bad bunnies&quot; go. While most employees worship it, Rack, Shack, and Benny cling to their Christian faith.\n\nDirector:\nPhil Vischer\nStars:\nKristin Blegen, Mike Nawrocki and Mike Sage ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51985c256de3909e7740b301f0c4146863259135","amp;dn":"1998.VeggieTales.Rack%2C.Shack.%26.Benny.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51985c256de3909e7740b301f0c4146863259135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,152,92,37,109,227,144,158,119,64,179,1,240,196,20,104,99,37,145,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
