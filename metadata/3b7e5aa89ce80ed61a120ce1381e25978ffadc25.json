He is a reluctant French spy    \n and is captured and spends time in a Union prison.      \n There are two parallel love stories (he is French) and  \n some battles with his uncle for control of the family   \n vineyard (because his father married his mother who the \n uncle also loved).                                      \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n                Hugh Grant ...

There are still  \n  small sync issues in some of the movie, but the final is     \n  much better than the source sync.
