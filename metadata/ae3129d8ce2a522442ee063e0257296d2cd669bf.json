But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.\n\nDVD Information+++++++++++\n+Format...................:  NTSC Region 0 (Region Free)\n+Video....................:  DVD5\n+Audio....................:  English DD 5.1\n+Subs.....................:  English, Spanish\n+Aspect...................:  Widescreen (16:9)\n+Menu.....................:  Yes\n+Extras/Special Features..:  Yes\n+Removed..................:  Advertisements, FBI Warnings, Trailers\n\nGeneral Information+++++++++\n+Copied Using Latest DVDFab Platinum\n+Compressed And Re-Encoded Using DVD-RB Pro + CCE\n+CCE Passes - 3\n+Other Stuff Is For Me To Know And For You To Wish You Knew :)\n\nI want to thank you for choosing one of my DVD torrents.
