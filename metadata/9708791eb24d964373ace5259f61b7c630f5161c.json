Twenty thousand years ago, the Earth is overrun by freezing temperatures in an Ice Age that is sending all manner of critters scattering in the path of encroaching glaciers. When a lost human infant is discovered, an unlikely quartet of misfits forms to return it to its mother: Manny, a depressed woolly mammoth (Ray Romano); Sid, a fast-talking sloth (John Leguizamo); an acorn-crazed squirrel named Scrat (Wedge); and the devilish saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary). Before they can complete their mission, the reluctant compatriots will brave pits of boiling lava, dangerous caverns of ice, and even a traitorous plot within their midst. Ice Age (2002) also features the voices of Jack Black, Jane Krakowski, and Goran Visnjic. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 21 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9708791eb24d964373ace5259f61b7c630f5161c","amp;dn":"Ice+Age%282002%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9708791eb24d964373ace5259f61b7c630f5161c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,8,121,30,178,77,150,67,115,172,229,37,159,97,183,198,48,245,22,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
