Tien is carefree and a total playboyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“or so he seems. Tupe, however, is a stern guy who is a workaholic and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care for any romance. So when Tien meets Krachao (Min) at a beauty pageant, it was like love at first sightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“or so he thought. TienÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother got very worried and asked Tupe to fly back from Switzerland to deal with his little brother. Meanwhile, his father doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really care and totally stays indifferent.\n\nKrachao didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly care for Tien thinking that he was just some drunk loser that she would never meet again. Plus, she didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the time to deal with him anyway since she has a drunkard as a mother and her father left to be with some other woman issues to deal with! KrachaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother kept pressuring her into finding a rich husband so that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be rich, hoping that KrachaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father would come back to them. Krachao caves in and decides to go to work where Meegrob (Sammie) is working when she found out that the family have a single son!\n\nAnd you guess it, Tupe and Tien are the owners of the Rachinee Orchid Farm, the best and most well-known orchid farm in Thailand. A little mishap occurred that caused Tupe to believe that Krachao is a terrible woman. He tries in every way to get in between Krachao and Tupe in order to protect his little brother. Was he wrong? He wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, as Meegrob was trying to help Krachao catch Tien as well! However, Krachao isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really into Tien and Meegrob happens to have a crush on him too. Oh, not to mention that Tupe starts having feelings for the girl his brother is going for!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5f9e783edd3f825af8898e096bc8720dec183d","amp;dn":"Bundai+Dokruk+%28Stairway+to+his+heart%29+TV%26+series+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5f9e783edd3f825af8898e096bc8720dec183d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,95,158,120,62,221,63,130,90,248,137,142,9,107,200,114,13,236,24,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
