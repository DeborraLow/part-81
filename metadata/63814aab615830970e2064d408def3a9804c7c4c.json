If somehow you managed to miss that band and their\nhybrid of minimalist yet ultra-powerful doom, noise, sludge\nand grim black metal, here is your chance to get addicted\nto captivating and uplifting ugliness. If however you are\nthe surviving victim of their oppressive sound, you know\nthat it is yet another blessing.
