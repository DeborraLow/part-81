Additional guests include retired FBI agent Don Adams, who contends Lee Harvey Oswald could not have killed John F. Kennedy, and Joel Skousen, founder and chief editor of World Affairs Brief, a weekly news analysis service. Mr. Skousen talks about Chuck Baldwin's article, Top Secret America: The Rest Of The Story, and the dark side of America's army and secret police.&quot;\n\nIt appears that Alex recorded a short into in which he mentions today's date [Sunday, August 29], but he stopped short of saying the show was &quot;live.&quot;\n\nRon Paul from August 18\nJoel Skousen from August 19\nDon Adams from August 26\n\nIn his intro for the second hour, Alex does say that this is &quot;an encore, best-of&quot; presentation.\n\n\n\nThe 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.\n\n\n\n\n \n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
