Some 40,000 people have been killed since 2006, when President Felipe Calderon deployed Mexican military and security forces in the so-called war against the cartels - often in gruesome and sadistic ways.\n\n\nBut behind the headlines, under cover of impunity, a low-intensity war is being waged.\n\nIn the second episode of a two-part series, Josh Rushing and the Fault Lines team travel to the state of Guerrero to investigate claims that Mexican security forces are using the drug war as a pretext to repress indigenous and campesino communities.\n\nIn one of Mexico's poorest and top drug-producing states, where struggling farmers are surrounded by the narco-economy, we ask about the cost of taking the struggle against dispossession into your own hands.\n\nFLV: http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/faultlines/2011/06/201162174315458265.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c47171c2eb54d83624cd1094041d88f74ca1b37","amp;dn":"Fault+Lines%7EMexico%5C%27s+Hidden+War++2011+06++20+++Aljazeera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c47171c2eb54d83624cd1094041d88f74ca1b37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,71,23,28,46,181,77,131,98,76,209,9,64,65,216,143,116,202,27,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
