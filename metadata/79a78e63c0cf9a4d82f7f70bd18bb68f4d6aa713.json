The Atlas will help readers of the Bible understand the contexts in which its stories are set and to appreciate the world from which it emerged and which formed its background. Maps show the geographical setting of the Bible's stories and reflect the successive stages of the Bible's accounts, while specially chosen full-colour illustrations bring the countries and their peoples to life. The accompanying text describes the land of Palestine, and its wider ancient Near Eastern and east Mediterranean settings. It outlines clearly the successive historical periods, and describes the major civilizations with which Israelites, Jews, and early Christians came into contact. There is also an illustrated survey of the relevance of archaeology for the study of the Bible. The Atlas provides a superb guide to the geography of the Holy Land throughout biblical history, from the Exodus period through to New Testament times.\n\nFormat: http://get.adobe.com/reader/PDF\n\nThanks For Downloading , but Plz Seed after finishing \nThanks :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a78e63c0cf9a4d82f7f70bd18bb68f4d6aa713","amp;dn":"Oxford+Bible+Atlas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a78e63c0cf9a4d82f7f70bd18bb68f4d6aa713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,167,142,99,192,207,154,77,130,247,247,11,209,139,182,143,77,106,167,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
