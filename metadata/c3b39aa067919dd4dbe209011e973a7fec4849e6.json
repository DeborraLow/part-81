When she dreamed one night that her horse was dying, only to wake the next morning and find the horse dead, she dismissed the incident as a coincidence. Then she dreamed she would die at age 48 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ only one year away. When Hardie does get ill, just as the dream predicted, she visits neuroscience experts and eventually a shaman. The Edge of Dreaming is an evocative, intimate chronicle of that year and a fascinating investigation into the human subconscious.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 855 MiB for 1h 26mn 35s 736ms\nCodec             : DivX\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 238 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 360 (1.778) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b39aa067919dd4dbe209011e973a7fec4849e6","amp;dn":"POV.S23E09.The.Edge.of.Dreaming.HDTV.DivX-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b39aa067919dd4dbe209011e973a7fec4849e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,179,154,160,103,145,157,212,219,226,9,1,30,151,58,127,236,72,73,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
