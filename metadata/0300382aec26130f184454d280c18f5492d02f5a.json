The last was released as Terminal Impact in 1995.\n\nCritical reception\n------------------\nCritical reception was generally, although not universally, poor. Halliwells Film Guide, for example, described it as a dim standard robot action fodder with a  violent, clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-ridden plot. Disagreeing with this assessment, M J Simpson, staff writer for SFX, described the film as one of the all-time great straight to video action flicks.\n\n\nPlayback Guide\n--------------\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player. \nJust burn the files onto a CD using Nero or Ashampoo Buring Studio by making a DATA CD.\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player \n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
