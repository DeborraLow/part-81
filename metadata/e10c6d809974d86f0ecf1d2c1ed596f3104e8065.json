This is technology in the public sphere today.\n\nAlso included are some miscellaneous tidbits on the organized stalking phenomenon, which is part and parcel of the shadow government / secret society network which runs everything now.    They are the true criminals; they are the true terrorists.\n\nAlso an article on the very convenient explosion at a water-fuel research company in Simi Valley, California, with the even more convenient presence of the local SWAT team right down the road.  There have been quite a few water-fuel discoveries in the past decade or so, and none ever seems to survive to see the light of day.   Also be sure and check out the documentary film &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car?&quot; if you haven't seen it already. \n\nFrom an associate of Jordan Maxwell.
