Delivered as something resembling a song cycle, this collection of material blends equal parts organic and electronic elements to create a hypnotic vibe throughout. Beginning with the massive riff work underpinning the &quot;Open the Gates&quot; instrumental, the equally powerful slow drive of &quot;I Met Her in the Candy Store&quot; is offset by the entrance of McKay's soft vocals. The guest vocal work of avant Japanese vocalist Haco on &quot;The Day&quot; is a logical, but well-played addition to the roster of lush sounds. But it's dreamy tracks like &quot;Sea Manta&quot; and the brief &quot;In Anticipation Of&quot; that help keep The Ride aloft as a truly modern end-to-end listening experience. Mixed and mastered under reportedly pressing circumstances, the album not only stands on its own as a solo project but as another testament to McKay's deft visions in sound.
