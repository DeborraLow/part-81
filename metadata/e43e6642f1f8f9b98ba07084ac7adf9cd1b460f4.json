Birthed in Syracuse, NY in early 2001 and propelled into the hardcore spotlight by critical acclaim, a raucous live show and an appearance on the Hellfest 2003 DVD, the ball started rolling and the bad hit the ground running hard.The tour offers were rolling in and management/booking agents were taking note. Then everything just stopped. On the outside, everything seemed to be getting better. But behind the scenes, the band was stalked by bad luck. Their new record is appropriately titled Bad Luck as it summed up their life as a band.
