The film was directed by Paul Greengrass, written by Tony Gilroy and Brian Helgeland, and produced by Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley. Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on 23 July 2004. It is the second in the Bourne film series. It was preceded by The Bourne Identity and is followed by The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia.[2] Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy surrounding the CIA and Operation Treadstone. The film also stars Franka Potente as Marie Kreutz, Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy and Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons.\n\n\nPLOT\n\nJason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) have been living incognito in Goa, India for the past two years where Bourne struggles to recall the specifics of his first mission as a black ops agent. In Berlin, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) runs a &quot;buy operation&quot;, spending $3 million to purchase evidence exposing the mole within the agency that stole $20 million in allocation money seven years prior. Before Landy's operative can complete the transaction, Russian FSB agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the building, plants a fingerprint to frame Bourne, kills Landy's operative and the seller of the information and makes off with the evidence and the $3 million. Kirill then reports back to Russian oil magnate Yuri Gretkov (Karel Roden), who sends him to Goa to finish the frame-job by assassinating Bourne. Bourne spots Kirill coming and flees with Marie in a jeep. Kirill gives chase and shoots at the vehicle to kill Bourne but kills Marie instead, causing the jeep to run off a bridge and crash into the river below. Kirill leaves, believing Bourne to be dead, but Bourne survives the accident and departs for Naples, Italy to seek vengeance.\n\nLandy follows the planted fingerprint lead and gains security clearance to sift through the CIA archives to investigate &quot;Operation Treadstone,&quot; an elite squad of assassins into which Bourne was enlisted. She stumbles upon evidence implicating Alexander Conklin, the late former director of the operation, leading her to question Conklin's boss, Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), who admits only to vague details. Landy gives a report to her supervisor, Operations Director Martin Marshall (Tomas Arana), advising that some years back, Russian politician Vladimir Neski acquired proof of the identity of the thief who stole the $20 million. When Neski threatened to make the information public he was killed by his wife in an apparent murder-suicide in a Berlin hotel room. Landy suspects Bourne and Conklin were responsible and the meeting is interrupted when a report comes in advising that Bourne has just been detained in Naples. Marshall orders both Abbott and Landy to apprehend him.\n\nTitolo originale The Bourne Supremacy\nPaese Stati Uniti d'America, Germania\nAnno 2004\nDurata 108 min\nRapporto 2,35:1\nGenere azione, thriller\nRegia Paul Greengrass\nSoggetto Robert Ludlum\nSceneggiatura Tony Gilroy\nFotografia Oliver Wood\n\n\nDATI DISCO\n\n\nDisc Info:\nDisc Title:\nDisc Size: 44,954,279,086 bytes\nProtection: AACS\nBD-Java: Yes\nBDInfo: 0.5.3\n\nPLAYLIST REPORT:\n\nName: 00999.MPLS\nLength: 1:48:31 (h:m:s)\nSize: 34,190,960,640 bytes\nTotal Bitrate: 42.01 Mbps\n\nVideo:\n\nCodec Bitrate Description\n----- ------- -----------\nVC-1 Video 28031 kbps 1080p / 23.976 fps / 16:9 / Advanced Profile 3\nVC-1 Video 2002 kbps 480p / 23.976 fps / 4:3 / Advanced Profile 2\nVC-1 Video 155 kbps 480i / 23.976 fps / 16:9 / Advanced Profile 2\n\nAudio:\n\nCodec Language Bitrate Description\n----- -------- ------- -----------\nDTS-HD Master Audio English 4231 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 4231 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)\nDTS Audio Chinese 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit\nDTS Audio French 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit\nDTS Audio German 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit\nDTS Audio Italian 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit\nDTS Audio Japanese 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit\nDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / DN -4dB / Dolby Surround\nDTS Express English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / 24-bit\n\nSubtitles:\n\nCodec Language Bitrate Description\n----- -------- ------- -----------\nPresentation Graphics English 43.446 kbps\nPresentation Graphics English 24.643 kbps\nPresentation Graphics English 70.686 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 17.852 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 14.375 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 15.117 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 29.027 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 29.077 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 83.199 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Chinese 70.546 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Danish 19.068 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Dutch 18.742 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Finnish 19.488 kbps\nPresentation Graphics French 20.678 kbps\nPresentation Graphics French 41.698 kbps\nPresentation Graphics French 62.883 kbps\nPresentation Graphics French 1.609 kbps\nPresentation Graphics German 14.375 kbps\nPresentation Graphics German 1.723 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Italian 19.454 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Italian 42.892 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Italian 58.839 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Italian 1.583 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Japanese 13.643 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Japanese 23.853 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Japanese 42.693 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Japanese 1.954 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Korean 13.828 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Norwegian 18.827 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Portuguese 20.326 kbps\nPresentation Graphics Spanish 1.631 kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29298fe6ddc34c451ea350a2ac38f5662d57b30d","amp;dn":"The+Bourne+Supremacy+%5BBluRay+Full+1080p+DTS+MULTI+6+MULTI+Sub%5D+n","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29298fe6ddc34c451ea350a2ac38f5662d57b30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,41,143,230,221,195,76,69,30,163,80,162,172,56,245,102,45,87,179,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
