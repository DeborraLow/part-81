Lawhead - [King Raven 01] - Hood\n\nFormats - EPUB,MOBI,LIT,PDF\n\nRobin Hood: The Legend Begins Anew\n\nFor centuries, the legend of Robin Hood and his band of thieves has captivated the imagination. Now the familiar tale takes on new life, fresh meaning, and an unexpected setting.\n\nHunted like an animal by Norman invaders, Bran ap Brychan, heir to the throne Elfael, has abandoned his father's kingdom and fled to the greenwood. There, in the primeval forest of the Welsh borders, danger surrounds himÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for this woodland is a living, breathing entity with mysterious powers and secrets, and Bran must find a way to make it his own if he is to survive.\n\nLike the forest itself, Hood is deep, dark, and at times savagely brutalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½yet full of enchantment and hope. Internationally-acclaimed author Stephen R. Lawhead has created a lyrical rendering of a time-honored story that will lead you down strange pathways into another time and place.
