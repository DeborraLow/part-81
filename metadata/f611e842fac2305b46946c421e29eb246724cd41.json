It was initially released as an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 in November 2006 in North America, Australia, and most of Europe and included a &quot;Limited Collector's Edition&quot; with added content and an art book titled Destroyed Beauty that detailed much of the game's back-story. Despite the initial statements of Xbox 360 exclusivity, a Microsoft Windows version of the game was developed in conjunction with People Can Fly and released a year later, featuring new content including additional campaign levels, a new multiplayer game mode, and Games for Windows LIVE functionality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f611e842fac2305b46946c421e29eb246724cd41","amp;dn":"GEAR%5C%27S+OF+WAR+-+XBOX360%5BREGION+FREE%5D+-+RespawnGames","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f611e842fac2305b46946c421e29eb246724cd41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,17,232,66,250,194,48,91,70,148,108,66,30,41,235,36,103,36,205,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
