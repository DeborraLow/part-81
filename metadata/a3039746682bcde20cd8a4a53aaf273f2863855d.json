The two video files are included for those viewers who do not have the entire 68 episodes in the miniseries.\n\nI don't know how long I will continue writing subtitles for more episodes.\n\nWriting subtitles for Upstairs,Downstairs is a more difficult job than for normal movies.The dialects and accents mixed in with occasional faulty audio recording made it impossible even to make a guess as to what is said in several places. These places (phrases) are put in parentheses, rather than replaced by a series of dashes or periods, so you can see my best guess. I am gaining skill in recognizing mistakes in subtitles during subsequent viewing. So perhaps later I will come back and correct any mistakes in this upload. \n\nRemember, these are your subtitles. Do with them what you will.  If you don't like what I've done, get yourself a copy of Subtitle Workshop and teach yourself how to edit my words. As time goes by perhaps some of you in a younger generation will pick up my work and improve it and extend it.\n\nMany old people here in my retirement home say they would have enjoyed watching the movie better if it weren't for the &quot;silly&quot; letters at the bottom of the picture. After watching movies with subtitles displayed (for my wife's benefit) I have developed a desire to have subtitles displayed on all videos, regular television shows or not. It seems to me now that experiencing the spoken word with two senses (sight and hearing) gives me a better comprehension of the story. \n\nInformation about the whole series at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLyrics of the songs at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\njgordon20904\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;107a777f62747f7e222029202450737f7d737163643e7e7564&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3039746682bcde20cd8a4a53aaf273f2863855d","amp;dn":"Upstairs%2C+Downstairs+subtitle+update+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3039746682bcde20cd8a4a53aaf273f2863855d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,3,151,70,104,43,205,226,12,216,164,165,58,175,39,63,40,99,133,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
