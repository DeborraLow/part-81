Over half a billion eggs have been pulled off U.S. shelves in the past two weeks following an outbreak of salmonella in the Midwest. Nearly 1,300 cases of people sickened by the eggs have been reported. Despite the size of the recall, responsibility falls on just two factory farmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg, both from Iowa.\n\n\n- David Kirby on &quot;The Looming Threat of Industrial Pig, Dairy and Poultry Farms on Humans and the Environment&quot;\n\nWe speak with David Kirby about his book, Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial Pig, Dairy and Poultry Farms on Humans and the Environment. &quot;We need more regulations and we need enforcement of the regulations,&quot; Kirby says. &quot;These [food] companies are self policing and they are operating on the honor system and consumers are obviously paying the price.&quot;\n\n\n- Report: Global Food Security and Sovereignty Threatened by Corporate and Government &quot;Land Grabs&quot; in Poor Countries\n\nSince the food crisis of 2008, food justice activists have warned that governments in concert with multi-national corporations have accelerated a worldwide &quot;land grab&quot; to buy up vast swaths of arable land in poor countries. According to the Economist magazine, between 37 to 49 million acres of farmland were put up for sale in deals involving foreign nationals between 2006 and mid-2009.\n\n\n- Judge Blocks Federal Funding For Embryonic Stem Cell Research\n\nA federal judge has blocked President Obama's executive order restoring funding for embryonic stem cell research. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the funding violates a 1996 law prohibiting federal money for any research that destroys or threatens human embryos. Obama's order had overturned a move by his predecessor George W. Bush to further restrict stem cell funding.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ddbc5fb008aa7c13913d45c29c78b20d61d185b","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+24+aug+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ddbc5fb008aa7c13913d45c29c78b20d61d185b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,219,197,251,0,138,167,193,57,19,212,92,41,199,139,32,214,29,24,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
