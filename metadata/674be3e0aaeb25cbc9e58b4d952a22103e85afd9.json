The game was released for Windows in the United States on September 22, 2003.\n\nJoWood is porting the game to the DS and it was listed in Microsoft to be developed by Pinnacle.\n\nIn the game Neighbours from Hell, the player creeps around the neighbourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. The player is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called Chilli, both of whom will try to alert the Neighbour of Woody's presence.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nWindows 95/98/ME/2000/XP with 64MB RAM, Intel Pentium MMX 166 Mhz, DirectX 8 compatible video card with 16MB RAM, DirectX 8 compatible sound card, 130MB free hard disk space, 4x CD-ROM drive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674be3e0aaeb25cbc9e58b4d952a22103e85afd9","amp;dn":"Neighbours+From+Hell+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674be3e0aaeb25cbc9e58b4d952a22103e85afd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,75,227,224,170,235,37,203,201,229,139,77,149,42,34,16,62,133,175,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
