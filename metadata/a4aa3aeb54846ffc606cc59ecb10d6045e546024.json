It peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart in 2004.\n\n&quot;Feels Like Today&quot; was featured on the Smallville: The Metropolis Mix soundtrack.

It was released in September 2004 on Lyric Street Records (see 2004 in country music), has sold 5,149,000 copies in the United States as of October 18, 2009,[1] and has been certified 5ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. The album produced singles in its title track, &quot;Bless the Broken Road&quot;, &quot;Fast Cars and Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Skin (Sarabeth)&quot;. &quot;Bless the Broken Road&quot; was initially recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and has also been recorded by Marcus Hummon, Melodie Crittenden (whose version was a #42 country single in 1997), and Geoff Moore before the release of Rascal Flatts' version. It would later be a Top 5 Christian hit for Selah as well. &quot;When the Sand Runs Out&quot; was later recorded by Marty Raybon on his 2006 album of the same name.\n\n&quot;Skin (Sarabeth)&quot;, initially a hidden track, received enough airplay to enter Top 40 on the country charts in 2005, leading to its release as a single after &quot;Fast Cars and Freedom&quot;. Upon its release to radio, &quot;Skin (Sarabeth)&quot; was officially added to the tracklist. &quot;Here's to You&quot; also charted from unsolicited airplay, and was made into a music video.\n\nRascal Flatts is a country music band founded in Lufkin, Texas. Since its inception, Rascal Flatts has been composed of three members: Gary LeVox (lead vocals), Jay DeMarcus (bass guitar, keyboards/piano, vocals), and JoeDon Rooney (lead guitar, vocals). DeMarcus and LeVox are also second cousins.\n\nRascal Flatts has released six studio albums and a greatest hits album, all on Lyric Street Records. Their first two albums, 2000's Rascal Flatts and 2002's Melt, have been certified 2ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum and 3ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum, respectively, in the United States, while 2004's Feels Like Today and 2006's Me and My Gang have received 5ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum and 5ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum certifications respectively. 2007's Still Feels Good is certified 2ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum. Their new album, Unstoppable, was released on April 7, 2009, and has been certified platinum.\n\nThey have also released twenty-seven singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including ten Number Ones. A cover of Tom Cochrane's &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;, from the soundtrack to the 2006 film Cars, also entered the country music charts from unsolicited airplay. Their longest-lasting Number One is &quot;Bless the Broken Road&quot; (late 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“early 2005) at five weeks, while their biggest crossover single is &quot;What Hurts the Most&quot;, which topped both the country and Adult Contemporary charts in 2006, and was a Top Ten pop hit.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4aa3aeb54846ffc606cc59ecb10d6045e546024","amp;dn":"Rascal+Flatts+-+Feels+Like+Today+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4aa3aeb54846ffc606cc59ecb10d6045e546024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,170,58,235,84,132,111,252,96,108,197,158,203,16,214,4,94,84,96,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
