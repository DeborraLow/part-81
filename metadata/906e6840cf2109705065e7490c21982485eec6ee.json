With the popular tracks &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; getting heavy airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations, the album sold one million copies by the end of the year and steadily climbed the charts, peaking at #18 on the Billboard 200 in March 1979. The album was ranked #4 on Billboard's Top Pop Albums of 1979 year end chart. The Cars remained on the album chart for 139 weeks with four more tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; and &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ becoming AOR radio favorites.\n\nThe album was re-issued as a Deluxe Edition on April 20, 1999, containing demos of the entire album alongside five previously unreleased demos.\n\nRolling stone's magazine ranked the album 279 in 500 best albums of all time.\n\nThe cover model is Natalya Medvedeva, a Russian-born model, journalist, and musician who died in 2003.\n\n&quot;Moving in Stereo&quot; was used as the theme for Phoebe Cates' famous pool scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; was covered by The Smashing Pumpkins and released on their 1996 box set The Aeroplane Flies High.\n\nThe Cars, in its entirety, was released as downloadable content for the music video game Rock Band on May 27, 2008.\n\nThe Cars were an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone described The Cars' musical style by saying: &quot;they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;\n\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek has always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, flatly telling one interviewer in 1997 &quot;I'm saying never and you can count on that.&quot; Easton and Hawkes, however, joined with Todd Rundgren in 2005 to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performs classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906e6840cf2109705065e7490c21982485eec6ee","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Let+The+Good+Times+Roll%28Live-Beat+Club%29%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906e6840cf2109705065e7490c21982485eec6ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,110,104,64,207,33,9,112,80,101,231,73,12,33,152,36,133,238,198,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
