Around 7,000 publicly-funded\nschools - one in three - now has a religious affiliation.\n\nAs the coalition government paves the way for more faith-based education by\npromoting 'free schools', the renowned atheist and evolutionary biologist\nProfessor Richard Dawkins says enough is enough.\n\nIn this passionately argued film, Dawkins calls on us to reconsider the\nconsequences of faith education, which, he argues, bamboozles parents and\nindoctrinates and divides children.\n\nThe film features robust exchanges with former Secretary of State for Education\nCharles Clarke, Head of the Church of England Education Service Reverend Janina\nAinsworth, and the Chair of the Association of Muslim Schools, Dr Mohammed\nMukadam.\n\nIt also features insights from child psychologists and key players in faith\neducation as well as insights from both parents and pupils.\n\nDawkins also draws on his own personal history as a father, arguing that the\ngovernment must stop funding new faith schools, and urges society to respect a\nchild's right to freedom of belief.\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Faith School Menace.WnA.avi\nFilesize.....: 500 MB (or 512,014 KB or 524,302,336 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:47:21 (71,023 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1339 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 129 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.98rÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯\nFrame Size...: 704x400 (1.76:1) [=44:25]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fc025a9d2c6fba2233ffd3c8eadd3538d133fe","amp;dn":"Faith+School+Menace.WnA.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fc025a9d2c6fba2233ffd3c8eadd3538d133fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,252,2,90,157,44,111,186,34,51,255,211,200,234,221,53,56,209,51,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
