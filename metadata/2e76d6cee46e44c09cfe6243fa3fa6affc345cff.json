He presented his contention that the ancient Egyptian builders of the pyramids and temples used advanced tools to construct various monuments, and statues, in addition to the pyramids. There is precisely crafted granite within a thousandth of an inch, which demonstrates a high level of skill and geometry, he said. Statues of Ramses, for instance, 1,000 tons each, are so precisely cut that it would be difficult to replicate today, he detailed. \n\nIn contacting stone sculptor, Mike Leckie, he confirmed to Dunn that these ancient Egyptian statues couldn't be made with the tools he has at his disposal. Using photographic analysis and computer design software, Dunn concluded that making the statues would likely have required diamond or ultrasonic tools run by electricity. \n\nIn his earlier work, he suggested the function of the Giza Pyramids wasn't as a tomb, but rather as a machine-- a holistic power plant that could draw energy from the earth. &quot;The ancient Egyptians had a sophisticated knowledge of science and technology,&quot; but evidence for their tools might have been wiped out in an extinction event or cataclysm, he theorized. \n\nAttack on Iran?\nFirst hour guest, author and columnist Jerome Corsi commented on a possible attack on Iran by Israel. A former US ambassador, John Bolton, has warned that Israel has just a few days to launch a strike against Iran in order to stop them from developing a nuclear bomb. Corsi thinks it's a bad idea for Israel to attack Iran, and that such a conflict could ignite a third World War. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\n-gizapower.com\n-gilfordsecurities.com\nBook(s):\n-Lost Technologies of Ancient Egypt\n-The Giza Power Plant\n-Why Israel Can't Wait\n-Atomic Iran","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e76d6cee46e44c09cfe6243fa3fa6affc345cff","amp;dn":"Coast+To+Coast+Am+-+08-17-10+-+Egypt%5C%27s+Lost+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e76d6cee46e44c09cfe6243fa3fa6affc345cff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,118,214,206,228,110,68,192,156,254,98,67,250,63,166,175,252,52,92,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
