Many of her earlier songs such as &quot;He Is Exalted&quot;, &quot;We Will Glorify,&quot; &quot;Lamb of God,&quot; and &quot;We Bow Down&quot;, are found in church hymnals or otherwise sung in church settings.\n\nAs a child she released her first album, Little Twila Paris, in 1965. The album included songs drawn from among those she sang with her family in their evangelistic outreaches.\n\nParis released her first full-length album, Knowin' You're Around, in 1980, and along the way she has written books, recorded children's music, and created worship songs. Her song &quot;God Is In Control&quot; won a GMA Song of the Year award in 1995 and her 1992 Sanctuary release won the GMA Praise &amp; Worship Album of the Year. She has won five GMA Dove Awards and three American Songwriter Awards.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Paris released mainly contemporary Christian pop songs. But in recent years, she has focused on recording new versions of some of her worship standards and writing new praise and worship music. Her 2005 album He Is Exalted: Live Worship collects a number of favorite songs commonly used in praise and worship of Paris's and presents them in a more typical style of live worship music. After her song &quot;He Is Exalted&quot; was used in churches in Brazil, Paris re-recorded it in the Portuguese translation they were using. This version appears on her 1992 album Sanctuary.\n\nAlthough associated for much of her career with Star Song Communications, EMI switched her to Sparrow Records in 1996, before her contract ended after 2003. In 2005, she switched to the praise and worship label Integrity Music for He Is Exalted: Live Worship.\n\nTwila released Small Sacrifice, on December 26, 2007 which was available only through her website and at Lifeway Christian Stores. This album married the two parts of her career by including both inspirational pop/adult contemporary songs and original praise and worship compositions. Her first radio single from Small Sacrifice was &quot;Live to Praise&quot;. &quot;Small Sacrifice&quot; was released for wider distribution by Koch Records on February 24, 2009.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae2ce0103a496835e51104235f799651c26c11a","amp;dn":"Twila+Paris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae2ce0103a496835e51104235f799651c26c11a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,226,206,1,3,164,150,131,94,81,16,66,53,247,153,101,28,38,193,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
