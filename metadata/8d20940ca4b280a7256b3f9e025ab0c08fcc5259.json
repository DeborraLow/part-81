Untangle 7.4 brings additional improvements throughout the Untangle suite of applications, and the Untangle platform itself. Untangle has also used this release as the opportunity to simplify its product line up. 'As our business has grown over the last two years, our offering has become increasingly complex,' Mark Floisand, COO, said: 'We have trebled our paying customer base in 18 months, and with that came more product packages and price points. With this release, we wanted to regain some of the simplicity inherent in our brand.' Untangle now offers three distinct packages: Untangle Lite Package, Untangle Standard Package, and Untangle Premium Package.&quot;\n\nChangelog : http://wiki.untangle.com/index.php/7.4_Changelog\nHomepage : http://www.untangle.com/\n\nmd5sum : 2bb3b7422e94d4bf26e9dabecbe907c5  untangle_740_x32.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d20940ca4b280a7256b3f9e025ab0c08fcc5259","amp;dn":"untangle_740_x32.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d20940ca4b280a7256b3f9e025ab0c08fcc5259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,32,148,12,164,178,128,167,37,107,63,158,2,90,176,192,143,204,82,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
