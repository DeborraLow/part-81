Snow leopards stalk their prey among the highest peaks. Concealed by snowfall, the chase is watched by golden eagles circling above. On the harsh plains of the Tibetan plateau live extraordinary bears and square-faced foxes hunting small rodents to survive. Valleys carved by glacial waters lead to hillsides covered by paddy fields containing the lifeline to the East, rice.\n\nTechnical Spec for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 58mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.70 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76debd783fd03724ebc514b7954e3d124e62d06f","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+The+Himalayas+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76debd783fd03724ebc514b7954e3d124e62d06f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,222,189,120,63,208,55,36,235,197,20,183,149,78,61,18,78,98,208,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
