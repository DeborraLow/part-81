Initially released in the US in 1987, then in NZ/Aus in 1989, the album has been through many variations and reissues over the years and probably stands as the band's best-selling compilation.\n\nReleased by the band's Northern Hemisphere record label A&amp;M Records, this version included the band's hits on the label. It was re-packaged in 2002 as The Best Of Split Enz - The Millennium Collection as part of Universal Music's &quot;20th Century Masters&quot; budget-priced series.\n\n   1. &quot;I Got You&quot; 3:31 (Neil Finn)\n   2. &quot;Hard Act To Follow&quot; 3:17 (Tim Finn)\n   3. &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot; 4:27 (Tim Finn/Split Enz)\n   4. &quot;What's The Matter With You&quot; 3:08 (Neil Finn)\n   5. &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; 2:53 (Neil Finn)\n   6. &quot;I See Red&quot; 3:16 (Tim Finn)\n   7. &quot;Message To My Girl&quot; 4:02 (Neil Finn)\n   8. &quot;History Never Repeats&quot; 3:00 (Neil Finn)\n   9. &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; 4:33 (Tim Finn)\n  10. &quot;Dirty Creature&quot; 4:03 (Tim Finn/Nigel Griggs/Neil Finn)\n  11. &quot;Poor Boy&quot; 3:26 (Tim Finn)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45af0508683ecd71f39b762b7506321cc485e02","amp;dn":"Split+Enz+-+History+Never+Repeats+%3A+The+Best+of+Split+Enz+-+US+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45af0508683ecd71f39b762b7506321cc485e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,90,240,80,134,131,236,215,31,57,183,98,183,80,99,33,204,72,94,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
