Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.\n\nHaving adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely-layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.\n\n\nDescription\n\n&quot;Shadow of the Day&quot; is a power ballad by American rock band Linkin Park. The song was released as the third single from their third album, Minutes to Midnight, on October 16, 2007. The first public performance for the song was at the Projekt Revolution tour in Auburn, Washington on July 25, 2007.\n\nThe band experimented with several different versions of the keyboard loop, before deciding on the one used in the final version. Lead singer Chester Bennington explained that they used over 60 different beats for this song until they found the suitable one. They also used different types of instruments like banjos at first, just experimenting on different styles until they came up with something that could fit the track.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe music video was directed by Joe Hahn. It takes place during a large scale civil unrest in what appears to be the United States. The video was shot in Los Angeles at 20th Century Fox. The action was set up by stunt coordinator Steven Ho.\nThe music video was released to the internet on October 15, 2007. The video shows Chester Bennington waking up. His alarm clock reads 11:55, the then Doomsday Clock time, referencing the album title Minutes to Midnight and the song which is the 5th song on the album. The video is over four minutes long, meaning that the time at the end would be 11:59 PM, or one minute to midnight. Chester then watches the news, washes up, gets dressed, and goes outside. We then see that the video takes place in a war-torn world, where mass chaos is ensuing on the streets of the city. There is a lot of violence going on with many police and gunshots. Plumes of smoke can be seen in the sky. Soldiers and riot police can be seen forcefully detaining civilians. Near the end of the video, a car is set on fire and bursts into flames as several people taking place in the riot throw molotov cocktails at police resulting in the Police Riot Control and SWAT teams opening fire and advancing while the mob of people retreat. A man suddenly throw a bottle of alcohol on a car and the car takes fire, explaining the title of the song &quot; Shadow Of The Day&quot; Chester then stands in front of the burning car, while looking hopelessly at the carnage that surrounds him. He then turns towards the flames, and the video fades to black. The electronic/ synth outro of the song is excluded on the video to make it a more appropriate finish. If listened to carefully towards the middle of the video, the mob is shouting 'we want freedom', telling us the reason why people are fighting.\n\nThis is the only video so far with only Chester appearing, as Brad, Rob, Mike, Joe and Phoenix are absent in it. The video isn't completely dubbed by the song, meaning sound effects taking place in the video can be heard. It is also interesting to note when the music video was released on the Internet, during the scene where a person sets a car on fire, the sound effects of the glass bottle he threw shattering on the car and igniting on fire is out of sync with the video. However, this problem was fixed on the band's officialpage.\nThe video has similarities to &quot;From the Inside&quot;; another riot-based video by the band. There is also a painting of a whale in the video; this is a reference to the &quot;In the End&quot; music video or the weight of human responsibilities and sins. A director's cut which is available at Joe Hahn's section of the Linkin Park website. In this version there are several scenes not in other versions. Chester is seen carrying a bag which he drops on the ground around 3:18 into the song. A few seconds later it goes back to Chester's house and zooms in on a table containing lots of wires and other electronics. There are also several blueprints and video monitors for security cameras displaying a certain building. After about 30 seconds there is a giant explosion destroying the building that the video monitors were displaying. This alludes that Chester had built a bomb and it was in the bag that he was carrying. He then had planned to bomb that building during the riot.\n\nAn alternate ending to the video, which shows Chester begin to walk away from the flames. The police open fire, and the video ends with a shot of Chester's bag falling to the ground. What actually happens to Chester is not revealed, but it can be assumed that either he was shot and killed or he threw his bag away and joined the riot. The alternate ending is only shown on MTV Europe music channels.\n\nMTV Overdrive contains a version which scenes with gunfire and bottle smashing are cut and replaced with different riot scenes.\nThe song was also featured in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nThe video won Best Rock Video at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and was also nominated for Best Direction in a Video.\n\n\n\nLyrics\n\nI close both locks below the window\nI close both blinds and turn away\n\nSometimes solutions aren't so simple\nSometimes good bye's the only way\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the sun will set for you\nThe sun will set for you\n\nAnd the shadow of the day\nWill embrace the world in grey\n\nAnd the sun will set for you\n[End Chorus]\n\nIn cards and flowers on your window\nYour friends all plead for you to stay\n\nSometimes beginnings aren't so simple\nSometimes good bye's the only way\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the sun will set for you\nThe sun will set for you\n\nAnd the shadow of the day\nWill embrace the world in grey\n\nAnd the sun will set for you\n\nAnd the shadow of the day\nWill embrace the world in grey\n\nAnd the sun will set for you\n\nAnd the shadow of the day\nWill embrace the world in grey\n\nAnd the sun will set for you\n[End Chorus] \n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 97.8 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 52s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2,811 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nDuration                         : 4mn 52s\nBit rate                         : 2,531 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2,968 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1,280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nStream size                      : 88.1 MiB (90%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nDuration                         : 4mn 52s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 7.80 MiB (8%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a8f71f385c32cf924d33d2c1630c5df584e8e9","amp;dn":"Shadow+of+The+Day+-+Linkin+Park+%28MHD+720p%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a8f71f385c32cf924d33d2c1630c5df584e8e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,168,247,31,56,92,50,207,146,77,51,210,193,99,12,93,245,132,232,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
