Released in April 1993, the song charted in the United Kingdom and was a Top 30 hit, but failed to chart in the United States.\n     &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; was Harvey's first album proper since disbanding the original PJ Harvey trio in 1993.   It is considered to be PJ Harvey's breakthrough. It garnered massive critical acclaim worldwide and became her best-selling album' reaching #2 on Billboard's Modern Rock chart.

Parish wrote and played the music, while Harvey sang vocals and wrote the lyrics.The album was viewed by many PJ Harvey fans as a minor side project. It yielded only one single, &quot;That Was My Veil&quot;, which spent a week at #75 in the UK charts. Harvey later admitted that she left all promotional duties for the record to Parish because she was exhausted following a year of intense promotional activity for her own &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; album in 1995. \n    &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; is a 2004 album by PJ Harvey.
