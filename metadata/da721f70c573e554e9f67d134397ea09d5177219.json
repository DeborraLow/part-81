Unfortunately, even after proving his canine credentials to mom and the kids, the heroic hound gets nowhere with uptight dad, George. But when a beastly veterinarian makes Beethoven the target of an unspeakable animal experiment, George becomes the only hope for saving the Newton's furriest family member.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da721f70c573e554e9f67d134397ea09d5177219","amp;dn":"Beethoven+%5B1992+Movie%5D+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da721f70c573e554e9f67d134397ea09d5177219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,114,31,112,197,115,229,84,233,246,125,19,67,151,234,9,213,23,114,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
