Illustrating the progression of atonality that baned the way for the 'modern crisis' as he puts it. Systematically anylyzing each piece (respectively Berlioz' 'Romeo and Juliet, Wagner's 'Tristan' and Debussy's 'Faun') with the metods layed out in the previous three lectures, he shows how tonal ambiguity becomes increasingly prevalescent in the 19th century and decreasingly 'contained' by traditional diatonicism. Especially interresting is his analysis of Wagners use of the dimished 7th chord, and Debussy's use of the tritone and whole-note scale.\n\n********** This is a repost of an old torrent worth reviving **********\n\nThanks to the original uploader and, please seed it as long as you can.
