It concentrates on &quot;desktop&quot; use so that it is ready for internet, multimedia, document and general home use out of the box. Absolute is lightweight -- meaning 2 things: that it can run on on older hardware and that the OS interface stays out of your way.\nIt is version-compatible with Slackware so you can use almost any package from the same version of Slack on Absolute. Development libraries (headers) for everything installed are always included, so you can code and/or build almost anything from source.\nIt is what I use all day, every day, and I am very thankful for Linux and Slackware and I hope others find benefit from my work on Absolute.\n--Paul Sherman'\n\nAbsolute 13.1.42 released\n  Friday, 09/03/2010:\n\nSecurity update main cause for version bump. A few new applications, lots of library package updates and a wee bit of interface tweaking. Starting to feel like a 13.1.x final. \n\nHomepage: http://www.absolutelinux.org/index.shtml\n\nmd5sum : ee1090bc3c2c62dba893301f4307a243  absolute-13.1.42.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef0daf1221a00e809ee06e809d74b88a520b42d","amp;dn":"absolute-13.1.42.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef0daf1221a00e809ee06e809d74b88a520b42d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,240,218,241,34,26,0,232,9,238,6,232,9,215,75,136,165,32,180,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
