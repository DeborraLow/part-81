And -- again -- better than his previous full-album effort, &quot;Let's Just Be.&quot; Keep on rolling along, Joseph.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ec01d02354b3166bf5445bb1c59c5f2d20b191","amp;dn":"Joseph+Arthur...Vagabond+Skies%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ec01d02354b3166bf5445bb1c59c5f2d20b191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,236,1,208,35,84,179,22,107,245,68,91,177,197,156,95,45,32,177,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
