It stars Barbara Harris, Bruce Dern, William Devane, and Karen Black. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. There were two working titles: Deceit and Missing Heir.\n\nThe film was adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman, based on the novel The Rainbird Pattern (1972)  Lehmann wanted the film to be sweeping, dark, and dramatic but Hitchcock kept pushing him toward lightness and comedy. Lehman's screenplay earned him a 1977 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f102cac3ad0258c05b33975ed8011735587f18d","amp;dn":"Plotting+Family+Plot+%5B2001%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f102cac3ad0258c05b33975ed8011735587f18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,16,44,172,58,208,37,140,5,179,57,117,237,128,17,115,85,135,241,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
