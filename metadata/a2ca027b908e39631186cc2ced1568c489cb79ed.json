There are a few official releases that sound absolutely terrific, but others that have been mixed are little more than a messy charade of prologic-esque channel distribution with a DTS name tag. What let me down the most was torrent for Led Zeppelin IV that had supposedly been remixed into DTS 5.1, but truth be told, it sounded awful. From there, I took it upon myself to begin remixing 2 channel audio into 5.1 and encoding it in DTS format. After that, remixing slowly turned into remastering as I learned more and began to play around with more advanced settings using Goldwave Pro.\n \n     Note: DTS is only an encoded format. A DTS album can come from low quality mp3 source and sound awful. Remember that when listening to DTS encoded audio. The source of this file was ripped from my copy of \\\\\\&quot;Under Great White Northern Lights\\\\\\&quot; by \\\\\\&quot;The White Stripes.\\\\\\&quot; I have tinkered with bass and treble levels, dynamic range, channel distribution, channel inversion, and various other settings. \n\n The reason this torrent only includes a single song is because I am looking for some feedback. Although it was easy to find fault with other DTS upmixes I found on the internet, I cannot claim that mine are perfect. I am not a professional, nor do I have any training in this field. I just really, really love music. So, for any who download this, please leave comments on what you think and if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth upmixing different albums so I can upload those. \n\n  In regards to playback, achieving such is not the easiest task in the world. Through my computer, I spent hours (and hours...and hours) trying to output multichannel audio through my sp/dif digital coax port to my external audio receiver. With certain programs (PowerDVD 10 Mark II and Corel WinDVD 10), I was able to tinker with countless settings (sound card settings, system volume at maximum, ffdshow, ac3filter, application settings, etc) and hear the music a few times. The easiest solution was my PS3 however, so if you have a PS3, that is the best option. I understand that not everyone has a PS3, so the following does not apply to everyone. However, there are a few settings necessary for DTS-WAV playback on the PS3 that I\\\\\\'ve listed below.\n\n              DTS-WAV Playback on PS3\n                 1. Music Settings \n                         -Output Frequency: \\\\\\&quot;44.1/88.2/176.4\\\\\\&quot;\n                         -Bitmapping: \\\\\\&quot;Off\\\\\\&quot; or \\\\\\&quot;Type 2\\\\\\&quot;\n                         -Dynamic Normalizer: \\\\\\&quot;Off\\\\\\&quot;\n                 2. Sound Settings\n                         -Audio Output Settings: DESELECT \\\\\\&quot;Linear PCM 2 Ch. 88.2 khz,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Linear PCM 2 Ch. 176.4 khz,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Linear PCM 2 Ch. 96 khz,\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Linear PCM 2 Ch. 192 khz\\\\\\&quot;\n                 3. Volume MUST be set to \\\\\\&quot;Normal\\\\\\&quot; in playback menu. \n                               \n                                 \n      In conclusion (For those who have bothered to read this far- I appreciate it), this is for testing purposes only. That is why it is a single file. Should you download this and successfully find a way to play it, please leave feedback so I can improve upon my methods and techniques and begin releasing albums, based both upon my preference as well as requests. Thank you all and enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2ca027b908e39631186cc2ced1568c489cb79ed","amp;dn":"Ball+and+a+Biscuit+%28DTS%29+-+The+White+Stripes+-+UGWNL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2ca027b908e39631186cc2ced1568c489cb79ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,202,2,123,144,142,57,99,17,134,204,44,237,21,104,196,137,203,121,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
