Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings each embody a range of emotions, Jojojo the monkey-like Pipling represents happiness, the rabbit-like Pipling Lau Lau represents imagination, De Li is kitten-like and represents love and Nok Tok is the bear-like Pipling who represents wisdom.\n\nWhen a Pipling is truly happy, does something good, or makes someone feel better they achieve &quot;buloo&quot; - a warm feeling of emotional harmony that is experienced by Piplings as floating. So Waybuloo is a journey to happiness - floating, spinning, dancing and soaring above the clouds of Nara. The unique world of Waybuloo helps young children develop their social and emotional learning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b7a1f5cc82798b9878715284bf5e1f15d84dc75","amp;dn":"Waybuloo%5BMeet-The-Piplings%5Dxvid+by+winker%40kidzcorner-1337x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b7a1f5cc82798b9878715284bf5e1f15d84dc75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,122,31,92,200,39,152,185,135,135,21,40,75,245,225,241,93,132,220,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
