Every time you try\nout a new program and then uninstall it your system gets more and\nmore clogged up with redundant program components that just get\nin the way and slow things down.\n\nAshampoo Uninstaller 4 completely eliminates this problem. It\nlets you test software with confidence because you can be sure\nthat no trace of programs you remove are left anywhere on your\nsystem. It does this by comparing compact Before and After\nsnapshots that identify exactly where all program components and\nsettings are located. Uninstalling is completely safe, with\nautomatic backups and a special Reinstaller for quickly\nreinstalling programs with all their settings.\n\nIn addition to uninstalling, you can also use UnInstallers\ncomprehensive Before and After comparisons to monitor and\nidentify the secret activities of any program  for example\nhidden files and Registry keys. Just take a snapshot, run the\napplication that you want to monitor and then take another\nsnapshot. UnInstaller then compares the snapshots and shows you\nall the changes the program has made anywhere on your system.\n\nAshampoo UnInstaller 4 is actually a complete Windows maintenance\npackage with over a dozen powerful tools. It comes with an\nadvanced hard disk defragmenter, a file wiper, a file undeleter,\nan Internet cleaner, a Windows Registry cleaner, a Windows system\nrestore point manager, file and folder backup and much more.

This means\nthat programs installed in several logged stages, for example\nwith multiple updates over a period of time, are now removed\nmuch more efficiently.\n\nNew Undeleter and File Wiper\nA powerful undelete tool for recovering accidentally deleted\nfiles and a wiper for completely removing all traces of\nsensitive files from your hard disk have been added to the\nUnInstaller toolkit in this version.\n\nImproved Hard Disk Defragmenter\nThe efficient hard disk defragmentation tool has received a\nmajor update and now includes boot time defragmentation,\nautomatic Pro-Active defragmentation when the hard disk is\nidle and multiple drive defragmentation with optional automatic\ncomputer shutdown when the process is complete.\n\nImproved Internet Cleaner\nThe Internet Cleaner deletes all traces of Internet surfing\nsessions from your computer (all browsers normally save records\nof everything you view). The new version supports all the\nlatest versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox, and now also\nallows Firefox users to choose which cookies they want to keep\nor delete.\n\nNew graphical user interface\nIn additional to the functional improvements Ashampoo\nUnInstaller 4 has been given an attractive new graphical user\ninterface that makes the program easier and more intuitive to\nuse.\n\nOther highlights\n\nIn addition to the new and improved features Ashampoo UnInstaller\n4 continues to offer all the other tools and features that have\nmade it so popular with novice and experienced users alike.\n\nInstallation Monitor\nThis small system tray tool identifies almost all program\ninstallations automatically, logging the entire installation\nprocess so that you can remove the program later with the\nAshampoo UnInstaller.\n\nMonitor secret program activities\nJust take a Before snapshot with UnInstaller, run the\napplication that you want to monitor and then take another\nsnapshot. UnInstaller will then show you all the changes the\nprogram has made anywhere on your system, including Registry\nentries, new files, file changes and other changes.\n\nReinstaller\nGet insurance against changing your mind Reinstaller\nreinstalls your removed programs along with all your individual\nsettings so that you dont have to go through the hassle of\nconfiguring everything all over again.\n\nDrag &amp; Drop Desktop Uninstaller\nJust drag the icon of a logged program onto the desktop icon to\nremove it from your computer with Ashampoo UnInstaller. Great\nfor getting rid of trial versions quickly.\n\nFind invalid installation entries\nAdd/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel often contains\ninvalid entries for programs no longer on your system. This\ntool locates and deletes these entries, freeing up resources on\nyour machine.\n\nManage system restore points\nWindows has a system for saving rollback backups of your\nsystem called restore points that allow you to return your\nsystem to an earlier state without losing your personal data\n(text documents, emails, browser history etc).

It also\nenables you to activate and deactivate automatic restore\npoints, create manual restore points and load restore points to\nreturn your system to a previous state.\n\nRegistry Cleaner\nThe Windows Registry is the central database where both Windows\nand most programs save all their (and your) settings.
