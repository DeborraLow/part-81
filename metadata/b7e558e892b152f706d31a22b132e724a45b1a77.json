The Overton Window is the perfect all-American thriller.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Brad Thor, #1 New York Times bestselling author\n\n&quot;A novel ripped from today's headlines and destined to be as controversial as it is eye-opening. No matter your politics, this Hitchcockian thriller will have you turning pages well into the night.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author\n\n&quot;A visionary work of fiction. One of the best thrillers I've read in years.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Vince Flynn, New York Times bestselling author\n\n&quot;Glenn Beck never fails to amaze. The Overton Window, a rip-roaring read of the first order, is as good a political thriller as you're going to find this year.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Nelson DeMille, New York Times bestselling author\nProduct Description\nA plan to destroy America, a hundred years in the making, is about to be unleashed . . . can it be stopped?\n\nThere is a powerful technique called the Overton Window that can shape our lives, our laws, and our future. It works by manipulating public perception so that ideas previously thought of as radical begin to seem acceptable over time. Move the Window and you change the debate. Change the debate and you change the country.\n\n\nFor Noah Gardner, a twentysomething public relations executive, it's safe to say that political theory is the furthest thing from his mind. Smart, single, handsome, and insulated from the world's problems by the wealth and power of his father, Noah is far more concerned about the future of his social life than the future of his country.\n\n\nBut all of that changes when Noah meets Molly Ross, a woman who is consumed by the knowledge that the America we know is about to be lost forever. She and her group of patriots have vowed to remember the past and fight for the future--but Noah, convinced they're just misguided conspiracy-theorists, isn't interested in lending his considerable skills to their cause.\n\n\nAnd then the world changes.\n\n\nAn unprecedented attack on U.S. soil shakes the country to the core and puts into motion a frightening plan, decades in the making, to transform America and demonize all those who stand in the way. Amidst the chaos, many don't know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact--or, more important, which side to fight for.\n\n\nBut for Noah, the choice is clear: Exposing the plan, and revealing the conspirators behind it, is the only way to save both the woman he loves and the individual freedoms he once took for granted.\n\n\nAfter five back-to-back #1 New York Times bestsellers, national radio and Fox News television host Glenn Beck has delivered a ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that seamlessly weaves together American history, frightening facts about our present condition, and a heart-stopping plot. The Overton Window will educate, enlighten, and, most important, entertain--with twists and revelations\nno one will see coming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e558e892b152f706d31a22b132e724a45b1a77","amp;dn":"the+overton+window+-+glenn+beck+64kbs+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e558e892b152f706d31a22b132e724a45b1a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,229,88,232,146,177,82,247,6,211,26,34,177,50,231,36,164,91,26,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
