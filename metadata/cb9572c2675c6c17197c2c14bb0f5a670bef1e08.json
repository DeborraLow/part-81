Can these feuding families put aside their grievances and foster a peace?\n\nFinger-Pointing Family\n\nGreg and Amy have only been married for 10 months, but the couple says AmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mom, Terry, is ruining their relationship. Greg says his mother-in-law is manipulative and controlling, and she even called Child Protective Services on him for allegedly abusing AmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s young children. \n\nManipulative Mother-in-Law?\n\nDonna, says her son-in-law, Steve, is an abusive parent who hits her grandchildren. Steve refutes this and says his mother-in-law is a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œman-haterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ trying to ruin his marriage. DonnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughters, Rochelle and Shannon, speak up about the family drama, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be surprised to learn who they think is to blame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9572c2675c6c17197c2c14bb0f5a670bef1e08","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2011.05.10.In-Laws.Face.Off.HDTV.Xvid-GRamos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9572c2675c6c17197c2c14bb0f5a670bef1e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,149,114,194,103,92,108,23,25,124,44,20,187,15,90,103,11,239,30,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
