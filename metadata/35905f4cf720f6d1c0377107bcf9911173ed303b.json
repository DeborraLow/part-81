When he shares the news with his devoted friends Chubby, a mechanic, and Ricco, a fast-food cook and would-be b-boy, they can't comprehend their thoughtful friend's willingness to trade camaraderie for a wider view of the world. Overcoming their anger and bewilderment, the guys decide to spend one last night with Floyd, but the problem, as always, is how to find some fun. A succession of fast-food restaurants, parking garages, and local watering holes chronicles the inherent boredom of life in the provinces. But a run-in with a convention of dragster-racing Elvis impersonators sends the boys and their friend Telsa Julia Hummer on a series of adventures that veers from the farcical to the almost-tragic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35905f4cf720f6d1c0377107bcf9911173ed303b","amp;dn":"Gigantics+%281999%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35905f4cf720f6d1c0377107bcf9911173ed303b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,144,95,76,247,32,246,209,192,55,113,7,188,249,145,17,115,237,48,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
