It was released in 1983 and was Lowe's fourth solo LP.\n\nNicholas Drain Lowe (born 24 March 1949, Walton-on-Thames), better known as Nick Lowe, is an English singer-songwriter, musician and producer.\n\nA pivotal figure in UK pub rock, punk rock and new wave, Lowe has recorded a string of well-reviewed solo albums. Along with vocals, Lowe plays guitar, bass guitar, piano and harmonica. He is best known for his songs &quot;(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot; (a hit for Elvis Costello), &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; (a U.S. Top 40 single), and &quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot;, as well as his production work with Costello.\n\nHe currently lives in Brentford, London, England.\n\nLowe began his musical career in 1967, when he joined the band Kippington Lodge, with his friend Brinsley Schwarz. They released a few singles on the Parlophone record label as Kippington Lodge before they re-named the band Brinsley Schwarz in late 1969, and began performing country and blues-rock. Lowe wrote some of his best-known compositions while a member of Brinsley Schwarz, including &quot;(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, a hit for Elvis Costello in 1979, and &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;, a solo hit for Lowe in 1979.\n\nAfter leaving Brinsley Schwarz in 1975, Lowe began playing in Rockpile with Dave Edmunds. In August 1976, Lowe released &quot;So It Goes&quot; b/w &quot;Heart of the City&quot;, the first single on the Stiff Records label where he was an in-house producer. The single and thus the label was funded by a loan of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£400 from Dr. Feelgood's Lee Brilleaux. The label's first EP was Lowe's 1977 four-track release Bowi, apparently named in response to David Bowie's contemporaneous LP Low. (The joke was repeated when Lowe produced The Rumour's album Max as an 'answer' to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours). Lowe continued producing albums on Stiff and other labels. In 1977 he produced Dr. Feelgood's album, Be Seeing You, which included his own song, &quot;That's It, I Quit&quot;. The following year's Dr. Feelgood album, Private Practice, contained a song Lowe jointly penned with Gypie Mayo - &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;. Along with &quot;I Love The Sound of Breaking Glass&quot;, &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot; is one of only two Lowe compositions to ever reach the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc26eb38fc6f86719d82cabe4be584fe997847cf","amp;dn":"Nick+Lowe+-+Ragin%5C%27+Eyes+%28Live-Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc26eb38fc6f86719d82cabe4be584fe997847cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,38,235,56,252,111,134,113,157,130,202,190,75,229,132,254,153,120,71,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
