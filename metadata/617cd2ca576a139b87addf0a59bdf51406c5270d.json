Like the Mystic Valley Band, Slow Ear takes its cues from country-rock and roots music, but it does so with a narrower scope, sticking mostly to Hollingsworth's acoustic guitar and tinny vocals. There's no critiquing Hollingsworth's talent as a guitarist -- he's a versatile pro, riffing on his unplugged instrument with all the flair he showed on his more electric-based projects -- and he's a competent lyricist to boot, with witty songs that spin tales of drug-fueled childhood shenanigans and adult lust. The guy can't sing a note to save his life, however. His vocals are alternately deadpan and squeaky-high, sometimes bordering on such cartoonish levels of helium-pitched nasality that they completely undermine his guitar playing. Hollingsworth may be a solid songwriter, but he's no vocalist, and these songs would sound infinitely stronger if he brought in someone else to sing them.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/18/taylor-hollingsworth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/18/taylor-hollingsworth/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:617cd2ca576a139b87addf0a59bdf51406c5270d","amp;dn":"Taylor+Hollingsworth...Life+with+a+Slow+Ear%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"617cd2ca576a139b87addf0a59bdf51406c5270d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,124,210,202,87,106,19,155,135,173,223,10,89,189,245,20,6,197,39,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
