Charlie is a freelance jingle composer and irresistible Cassanova who lives in a luxurious beach-house and rarely gets up before noon. Charlie &quot;temporarily&quot; allows Alan and his son Jake, a food-obsessed, lazy school kid who shuttles between his parents, to move in with them after Alan's separation/divorce. The sitcom revolves around their conflicting lifestyles, raising Jake (who has the efficient, caring dad while having a ball with his fun-loving sugar uncle who teaches him boyish things), and bantering with Evelyn and various other friends and family. Other fairly regular characters include Charlie's cleaning lady Berta and his rich, self-confessed stalker neighbor Rose who often sneaks in to spy on Charlie.\n\n\nComment Seed and enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47153e3569f9fb14745fc6dcb349262da80f822","amp;dn":"Two+And+A+Half+Men+Seasons+1+-+7+Complete+MKV+Compression+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47153e3569f9fb14745fc6dcb349262da80f822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,113,83,227,86,159,159,177,71,69,252,109,203,52,146,98,218,128,248,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
