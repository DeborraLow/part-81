TIKI, Bona's fourth solo effort, is a case study in world fusion. In addition to Bona's excellent chops (he plays many of the album's instruments himself, including the bass, for which he is particularly well known), the disc boasts an immediately appealing sound that draws heavily on Afro-Pop, but also boasts Latin rhythms, Indian melodies, American pop, R&amp;B, and funk elements, and nearly everything in between. Bona's beautiful, soothing vocals carry TIKI's memorable melodies, while guest appearances by John Legend, Susheela Ramen, and guitarist Mike Stern raise the world-class profile of this impressive release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb39817eb52bfce10b282331a6ccb14c13514a8","amp;dn":"Richard+Bona+-+Tiki+%282006%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb39817eb52bfce10b282331a6ccb14c13514a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,179,152,23,235,82,191,206,16,178,130,51,26,108,203,20,193,53,20,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
