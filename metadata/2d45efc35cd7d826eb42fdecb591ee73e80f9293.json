The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on psychology and psychiatry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d45efc35cd7d826eb42fdecb591ee73e80f9293","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine+-+October+2010+%28True+PDF%29%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d45efc35cd7d826eb42fdecb591ee73e80f9293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,69,239,195,92,215,216,38,235,66,253,236,181,145,238,115,232,15,146,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
