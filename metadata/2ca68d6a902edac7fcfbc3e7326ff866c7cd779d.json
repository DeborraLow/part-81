He was rehabilitated with the aid of Nigel Watson, the late Cozy Powell and other friends, and then began touring and recording with the Splinter Group. The group was disbanded in early 2004 with Green's departure from the group - an upcoming tour was cancelled, as was the planned release of a new album.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca68d6a902edac7fcfbc3e7326ff866c7cd779d","amp;dn":"Peter+Green+Splinter+Group-blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca68d6a902edac7fcfbc3e7326ff866c7cd779d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,166,141,106,144,46,218,199,252,251,195,231,50,111,248,102,199,205,119,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
