The early mid- to late-'80s hits that catapulted the label to recognition during the Russell Simmons/Rick Ruben era are here: LL Cool J's &quot;I Can't Live Without My Radio,&quot; Beastie Boys' &quot;Fight for Your Right,&quot; and Slick Rick's &quot;Children's Story.&quot;\nSo are plenty of the early-'90s hits that solidified Def Jam's status during a time when it finally had to fend off competitors and a fledging West Coast scene: Public Enemy's &quot;Fight the Power,&quot; EPMD's &quot;Crossover,&quot; and Onyx's &quot;Slam.&quot;\nAnd there are also a handful of the late-'90s hits that redefined Def Jam's image once the label shed many of its veteran artists: Jay-Z's &quot;Can I Get A...,&quot; DMX's &quot;Party (Up in Here),&quot; and Method Man's &quot;I'll Be There/You're All I Need.&quot;\nWhile the Def Jam Music Group -- Ten Year Anniversary box set is undeniably more thorough and informative, this convenient single-disc compilation features nothing but the big hits and also features the late-'90s artists that aren't found on that pricey box set.
