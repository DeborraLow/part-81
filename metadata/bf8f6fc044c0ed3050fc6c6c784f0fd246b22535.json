All information from using these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as this could conflict or damage Office 2010. For information about individual functions, read further below.\n\nOffice 2010 Toolkit Functions:\n\nMain Tab:\n\nEZ-Activator: This is a universal and simple activator for Office 2010. It can use KMS activation even if you are using Retail Office. EZ-Activator gathers information about your Office 2010 licensing status to provide the best method of activation. If you are using activated Retail or MAK Product Key, it will keep this Product Key and license as this activation is good forever unlike KMS which is for 180 days. Otherwise the MAK/Retail Product Keys will be uninstalled and replaced with KMS Product Keys, and Retail Office 2010 will be converted to Volume Edition. The EZ-Activator will then install AutoKMS and attempt to activate Office 2010 using the KMS Keygen.\n\nOffice 2010 Information: This displays if Office 2010 is installed on your PC and whether it is 32 bit (x86), 64 bit (x64) or 32 bit running on 64 bit OS (WOW).\n\nActivation Tools Tab:\n\nOffice 2010 AutoKMS: AutoKMS is a scheduled task that will reset your 180 day KMS activation. Unlike other KMS activators, AutoKMS does not run 24/7 or only at the last minute with the hope it won\\'t fail, and leaves no traces of itself other than a Scheduled Task and EXE file. It will run at boot and attempt KMS activation up to 25 times. It should not take that many times unless something is wrong, so it will warn you in that case. The Install/Uninstall buttons are used to install or remove AutoKMS from your PC.\n\nAttempt Office 2010 Activation: This will attempt to activate any and all Office 2010 products. The KMS Keygen will be run to activate KMS licenses, and online activation will be attempted for MAK and Retail keys.\n\nCheck Office 2010 Activation Status: This will display detailed information on Office 2010 activation including how many days you are licensed for, what Product Key and type of license you are using, and much more.\n\nRearm Office 2010: This resets the 30 day grace period that all Office 2010 products have. Rearm can be done up to 5 times.\n\nLicense Management Tab:\n\nAdd License: This will add the ability to use a license/Product Key for a certain Office 2010 product. You do not need that Office 2010 Product installed. \nIt will install a hardcoded Product Key if available, else you will have to install your own Product Key. All The Provided Retail Keys are trials or blacklisted but can be rearmed for temporary use.\nEX: This can be used to use Professional Plus license on Standard. \n\nThis also lets you convert from Retail to VL. Set License Type To Volume and select the Office 2010 Product you want to convert to VL, then press Add. \nNOTE: There are no VL versions of Home and Business, Home and Student, and Professional so convert them to Professional Plus.\n\nDelete All: This deletes all licensing information for Office 2010. This is meant to be used if your license details are corrupted/marked as tampered. This will force Office 2010 to repair itself and it will be in either Notifications Mode (VL) or Reduced-Functionality Mode (Retail). You will probably not be able to rearm to get out. You will have to activate which may fail with KMS Keygen. This is an absolute last resort and should be used sparingly. \nNOTE: When Office 2010 repairs itself, it restores licenses for what you have physically installed, any licenses Added/Converted using License Add or EZ-Activator will not be restored.\n\nKey Management Tab:\n\nAdd: This will install an Office 2010 Product Key, using either a hardcoded Product Key based upon your selection or a custom key that you enter. A Product Key cannot be installed unless you have that Office 2010 license installed.\n\nRemove: This will remove an Office 2010 Product Key, using either a hardcoded Product Key based upon your selection or a custom Product Key that you enter. \n\nCheck: This will give information on an Office 2010 Product Key, using either a hardcoded Product Key based upon your selection or a custom Product Key that you enter. This information is what you would get from a PIDX checker.\n\nLicense Backup Tab:\n\nBackup: This saves your Office 2010 licensing information so it can be restored later. This information is machine and install specific, so it probably won\\'t work after a reformat and definitely won\\'t work on different hardware. It saves the current state but does not stop the clock, so a 25 day old backup restored will be whatever days you had minus 25 when you took the backup. Backups are stored in subdirectories in a \\&quot;Backups\\&quot; folder that will be created in the same directory as the Office 2010 Toolkit executable using the name you entered.\n\nFull Restore: Restores all of the information saved in a previous backup. It will take a temporary backup of your current state, delete your current state, then restore the backup. If it fails to restore it will try to restore the temporary backup.\n\nTokens Only Restore: This is the same as Full Restore except it doesn\\'t touch the current registry. This is probably not enough to restore activation so if it fails try the Full Restore.\n\nGuys please help me to seed this torrent,hope you guys will like it..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8f6fc044c0ed3050fc6c6c784f0fd246b22535","amp;dn":"Office+2010+Toolkit+%26+EZ-Activator+2.0+Beta+3+%28Reupload%29+%2Apkaji1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8f6fc044c0ed3050fc6c6c784f0fd246b22535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,143,111,192,68,192,237,48,80,252,108,108,120,79,15,210,70,178,37,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
