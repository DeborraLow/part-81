He likes watching TV, repetitively listening to his polka records and munching crisps whilst in the bath. Oggy would love to lead an easy and peaceful life but is constantly being tormented by three hideous cockroaches. These hardened insects will do their utmost to make Oggy's life a misery. The cockroaches are not his only problem, Oggy's quiet life is also disrupted by Cousin Jack, bent on wiping out the cockroaches once and for all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f810b6208352b5bc4a8c0f134ffcdeec4115a33","amp;dn":"Oggy.And.The.Cockroaches.S03E03.H264.ACC.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f810b6208352b5bc4a8c0f134ffcdeec4115a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,129,11,98,8,53,43,91,196,168,192,241,52,255,205,238,196,17,90,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
