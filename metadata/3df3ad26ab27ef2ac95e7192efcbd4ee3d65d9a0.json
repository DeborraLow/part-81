Since this is \n\tPDTV we couldn't tag it proper, but we still wanted to \n\tmake it known. \n\n\tAlso VH1 has a habit of removing the opening titles and\n\tend credits when they reair multiple episodes so that is\n\twhy runtime is a bit short compared to normal. They were \n\tnot removed by us.\n\t\n\tINFO:\n\t\n\tMINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n\tthe gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df3ad26ab27ef2ac95e7192efcbd4ee3d65d9a0","amp;dn":"What.Chilli.Wants.S01E07.PDTV.XviD-MiNDTHEGAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df3ad26ab27ef2ac95e7192efcbd4ee3d65d9a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,243,173,38,171,39,239,42,201,94,113,146,239,203,212,238,61,101,217,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
