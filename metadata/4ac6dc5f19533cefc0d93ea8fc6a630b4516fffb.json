They pride themselves on being selflessly committed to the highest ideals and seem particularly confident of the purity of their motives and the evil nature of their opponents. To correct economic and social injustice, liberals support a whole litany of policies and principles: progressive taxes, affirmative action, childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rights, consumer rights, and much, much more.\n\nBut do they actually live by these beliefs? Peter Schweizer decided to investigate in depth the private lives of some prominent liberals and what he found was a long list of glaring contradictions.\n\nScheizerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conclusion is simple: liberalism in the end forces its adherents to become hypocrites. They adopt one pose in public, but when it comes to what matters most in their own livesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their property, their privacy, and their childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they jettison their liberal principles and embrace conservative ones. Schweizer thus exposes the contradiction at the core of liberalism: if these ideas donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work for the very individuals who promote them, how can they work for the rest of us.\n\nPeter Schweizer is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several books, including ReaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s War and The Bushes. He lives in Florida with his wife and their two children.\n\nPart 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Introduction\nPart 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Noam Chomsky\nPart 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Michael Moore\nPart 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Al Franken\nPart 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ted Kennedy\nPart 6ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Hillary Clinton\nPart 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ralph Nader\nPart 8ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Nancy Pelosi\nPart 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½George Soros\nPart 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Babara Streisand\nPart 11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Gloria Steinem\nPart 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cornel West\nPart 13ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Conclusion\n\n6 HoursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½5 Compact DiscsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½128 kbpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac6dc5f19533cefc0d93ea8fc6a630b4516fffb","amp;dn":"Peter+Schweizer-Do+As+I+Say+%28Not+As+I+Do%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac6dc5f19533cefc0d93ea8fc6a630b4516fffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,198,220,95,25,83,60,239,192,217,62,168,252,106,99,11,69,22,255,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
