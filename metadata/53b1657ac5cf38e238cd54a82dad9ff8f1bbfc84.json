Called Cultural Marxism, its goal is the use of art, music, education, and media to condition people to accept the essential elements of Marxism without identifying them as such. After a few generations of this conditioning, Marxism becomes the new reality without a violent revolution and even without awareness that a revolution has occurred. If you want to know how the nations of the world became increasingly Marxist in form, if not in name, here is the strategy.\n\nThe filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opening statement by Pat Buchanan prepares the viewer for what is to follow: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe United States has undergone a cultural, moral, and religious revolution. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ We are two countries now. We are two countries morally, culturally, socially, and theologically. Cultural wars do not lend themselves to peaceful co-existence. One side prevails, or the other prevails. The truth is that, while we won the Cold War with political and economic Communism, we lost the war with cultural Marxism, which now is dominant. Those of us who are traditionalists, we are the counterculture.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nIncludes testimony from G. Edward Griffin, Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Edwin Vieira, and Ted Baehr.\nDVD 98 mins.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b1657ac5cf38e238cd54a82dad9ff8f1bbfc84","amp;dn":"cultural+marxism.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b1657ac5cf38e238cd54a82dad9ff8f1bbfc84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,177,101,122,197,207,56,226,56,205,84,168,45,173,159,248,241,187,252,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
