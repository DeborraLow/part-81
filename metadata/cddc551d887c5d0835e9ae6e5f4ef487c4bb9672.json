She has not been seen since. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported she had been deported to Iran, although there has been no direct contact with her. The Committee to Protect Journalists is calling for her immediate release from Iranian authorities. We are joined by Kim Barker, the sister of Parvaz's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Todd Barker, who introduced the couple. She has known Parvaz for 12 years-they met as colleagues at the Seattle Times. Kim Barker is now a ProPublica reporter who has reported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. &quot;Dorothy is an amazing journalist, and an amazing human being,&quot; Kim Barker says.\n\n\n- &quot;Making Art In America Is A Political Statement In Itself&quot;: Grammy Award-winning Singer Steve Earle On Music, Writing and Acting\n\nSinger-songwriter, actor and author Steve Earle joins us in the studio to talk about his art and perform two songs from his new album, &quot;I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive.&quot; He is being awarded an honorary degree today from the City University of New York School of Law. Last year, he was honored by the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty for his years of involvement with the anti-death penalty movement. &quot;Making art in America is a political statement in itself,&quot; Earle says. &quot;I am maybe not so much a political songwriter as I am a political person.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cddc551d887c5d0835e9ae6e5f4ef487c4bb9672","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+13+may+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cddc551d887c5d0835e9ae6e5f4ef487c4bb9672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,220,85,29,136,124,93,8,53,233,174,110,95,78,244,135,196,187,150,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
