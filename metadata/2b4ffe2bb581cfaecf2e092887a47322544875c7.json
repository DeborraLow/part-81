Goodrem co-wrote some of the album with Guy Chambers, who also produced the album with Richard Flack and Steve Power. Mistaken Identity debuted at number-one on the Australian Albums Chart making it her second number-one album, but the sales did not match up to her previous album Innocent Eyes (2003) which sold 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album produced Goodrem two more number-one singles with &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and &quot;Almost Here&quot;, and the rest of the albums singles, &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; and &quot;A Little Too Late&quot;, became top twenty hits. The album features Goodrem's first duet, &quot;Almost Here&quot; (with Irish singer Brian McFadden).\n\nTrack listing\nAustralian Edition\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n1. \t&quot;Out of the Blue&quot;   \tDelta Goodrem Guy Chambers, \t4:25\n2. \t&quot;The Analyst&quot;   \tGoodrem, Chambers, Cathy Dennis \t3:36\n3. \t&quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;   \tGoodrem, Billymann \t4:01\n4. \t&quot;Extraordinary Day&quot;   \tGoodrem, Vince Pizzinga \t4:16\n5. \t&quot;A Little Too Late&quot;   \tGoodrem, Gary Barlow, Elliot Kennedy \t3:30\n6. \t&quot;Be Strong&quot;   \tGoodrem, Bridget Benenate, Matthew Gerrard \t4:03\n7. \t&quot;Electric Storm&quot;   \tGoodrem, Chambers, Dennis \t4:12\n8. \t&quot;Almost Here&quot; (duet with Brian McFadden) \tPaul Barry, Brian McFadden, Mark Taylor \t3:48\n9. \t&quot;Miscommunication&quot;   \tGoodrem, Chambers \t3:37\n10. \t&quot;Sanctuary&quot;   \tGoodrem, Chambers, Dennis \t3:50\n11. \t&quot;Last Night on Earth&quot;   \tGoodrem, Billymann, Chris Rojas \t  4:10\n12. \t&quot;Fragile&quot;   \tGoodrem, Adrian Hannan, Barbara Hannan \t3:39\n13. \t&quot;Disorientated&quot;   \tGoodrem, Pizzinga \t4:16\n14. \t&quot;You Are My Rock&quot;   \tGoodrem, Chambers \t3:25\n15. \t&quot;Nobody Listened&quot; (hidden track) \tGoodrem, Pizzinga \t4:18\n\nRipped using EAC.
