At the beginning of the game, Slate and his trusty dog Shadow are investigating a mysterious construction site. There, Slate discovers that someone very close to him has been murdered. Against direct orders, he sets off to find some answers and to seek revenge. The story, as told through Jack's deadpan narration and the occasional CG cutscene, seems pretty straightforward at first. During the course of the game, however, it actually takes some decent twists and eventually becomes quite involving. The best that can be said for it is that, unlike most stories in games, this one does a commendable job of tying up all its loose ends before the credits roll.\n\nFEATURES:\n- K-9 fighting companion, Shadow, assists in combat and retrieves items during conflicts.\n- Thirteen brutal new disarms moves to take down enemies in the heat of battle. More than 25 disarm moves in total!\n- Lightning-fast melee fighting system allows Jack to collect and use melee weapons throughout his environment, including bats, pipes, 2x4s, machetes and swords.\n- Jack's massive arsenal now includes heavy artillery such as mini-guns and shoulder-mounted RPGs. Also at Jack's disposal are devastating land mines, flechette grenades that shred human flesh and shotguns with incendiary shells that set your enemies ablaze. \n\nSystem requirements:\n- Processor: Pentium III 500 MHz\n- Memory: 256 MB\n- Video: 3D-graphics adapter with 64 Mb, compatible with DirectX\n- Sound: Sound card compatible with DirectX\n- Free hard drive space: 1.3 GB\n- Controls: A keyboard and mouse\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2995104018009e78ef70a8f5797d2969f876f3","amp;dn":"Dead+to+Rights+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2995104018009e78ef70a8f5797d2969f876f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,41,149,16,64,24,0,158,120,239,112,168,245,121,125,41,105,248,118,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
