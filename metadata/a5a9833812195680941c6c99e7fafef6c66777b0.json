One of seven children, Jackson left home at the age of twelve to find work at a furnace in Waterhouse. At seventeen, the effects of malnutrition had left him hospitalized, and on his release he was left with severe arthritis which had partially crippled his legs.[2] His physical condition meant that he was unable to return to his previous work, and he was forced into hustling a living on the streets of Kingston.\n\nHis Christian beliefs were markedly different from that of his Rastafarian contemporaries, which often prompted debate on religio-philosophical matters, and it was after one of these discussions that Jackson first headed towards a recording studio, having heard music &quot;like a strange ting, inside a my thoughts - like an angel a sing&quot;.\n\nAnother spell in hospital meant that finding money for recording was difficult, but eventually the &quot;Conquering Lion&quot; single was released late in 1972, credited to 'Vivian Jackson and the Ralph Brothers'. Cut for King Tubby, the popularity of the song and its distinctive introduction (the chant of &quot;Be-you, yabby-yabby-you&quot;) earned Jackson the nickname &quot;Yabby You&quot;, which has remained with him during his entire career.\n\nThe next few months saw the recording of several more singles, released under different names on various record labels, (although usually credited to 'Vivian Jackson and the Prophets', and often featuring a King Tubby 'version' on the b-side); culminating in the release of the Conquering Lion album. A King Tubby mixed dub set, King Tubby's Prophesy of Dub, was also issued, albeit on a limited run of 500 copies, helping to establish Jackson as a roots artist.\n\nYabby's success allowed him to branch out as a producer, and he began working with both upcoming and more established artists including Wayne Wade, Michael Rose, Tommy McCook, Michael Prophet, Big Youth, Trinity, Dillinger and Tapper Zukie, while continuing to release his own material.\n\nJackson continued to record, produce and perform (often with the aid of crutches) until the mid 1980s. He re-emerged in the early 1990s, issuing both new and old material, and his recordings have been the subject of several high quality reissues in recent years. In 2000 he released a singles remix project with Glen Brown. The album included remixes of &quot;Conquering Lion&quot; by Smith and Mighty, and a remix of Glen Brown by Small Axe and Terminal Head.\n\n\nTracklist :\n\n1 Introduction\n2 Fire in the City\n3 Know Why\n4 Jah Vengeance\n5 Fire Deh A Mus Mus Tail\n6 Leaving\n7 Chant Down Babylon Kingdom\n8 I am Stranger \n9 Outro\n\nEnjoyyyyy and Seed ............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a9833812195680941c6c99e7fafef6c66777b0","amp;dn":"Yabby+You+-+Live+at+Carribian+Culture+Club+%28+flac+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a9833812195680941c6c99e7fafef6c66777b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,169,131,56,18,25,86,128,148,28,108,153,231,250,254,246,198,103,119,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
