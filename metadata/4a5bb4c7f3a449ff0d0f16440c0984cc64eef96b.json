Hailing from Montreal in Canada, the seven-piece led by husband and wife team Win Butler and RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gine Chassagne returned with Neon Bible in 2007 to more plaudits. The album which featured tracks such as Keep The Car Running and Black Mirror was recorded in a renovated church in Quebec, along with sessions in Budapest and one by the Hudson River in New York. They toured the album widely including an appearance at Glastonbury.\n\nArcade Fire's return to the UK this year will allow Reading and Leeds goers the chance to hear tracks from their latest release, The Suburbs. Already receiving positive reviews from critics, this album sees the band experiment more with electronic sounds. Expect a powerful display of indie Americana when they hit the Main stage to unveil their new material. \n\n*Setlist not available, hopefully somebody can add it to the comments and I'll add it to the description later*\n\nSource: BBC iPlayer\nVideo Format: .FLV (Play with VLC or WMP Classic)\nAudio: 2ch stereo\nSize: 212MB\nLength: 36:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5bb4c7f3a449ff0d0f16440c0984cc64eef96b","amp;dn":"Arcade+Fire+-+Reading+%26+Leeds+Festival+2010+%5BDeZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5bb4c7f3a449ff0d0f16440c0984cc64eef96b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,91,180,199,243,164,73,255,13,15,22,68,12,9,132,204,100,238,249,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
