She vividly evokes Midland's brash, rugged culture, her close relationship with her father, and the bonds of early friendships that sustain her to this day. For the first time, in heart-wrenching detail, she writes about the devastating high school car accident that left her friend Mike Douglas dead and about her decades of unspoken grief.\n\nWhen Laura Welch first left West Texas in 1964, she never imagined that her journey would lead her to the world stage and the White House. After graduating from Southern Methodist University in 1968, in the thick of student rebellions across the country and at the dawn of the women's movement, she became an elementary school teacher, working in inner-city schools, then trained to be a librarian. At age thirty, she met George W. Bush, whom she had last passed in the hallway in seventh grade. Three months later, &quot;the old maid of Midland married Midland's most eligible bachelor.&quot; With rare intimacy and candor, Laura Bush writes about her early married life as she was thrust into one of America's most prominent political families, as well as her deep longing for children and her husband's decision to give up drinking. By 1993, she found herself in the full glare of the political spotlight. But just as her husband won the Texas governorship in a stunning upset victory, her father, Harold Welch, was dying in Midland.\n\nIn 2001, after one of the closest elections in American history, Laura Bush moved into the White House. Here she captures presidential life in the harrowing days and weeks after 9/11, when fighter-jet cover echoed through the walls and security scares sent the family to an underground shelter. She writes openly about the White House during wartime, the withering and relentless media spotlight, and the transformation of her role as she began to understand the power of the first lady. One of the first U.S. officials to visit war-torn Afghanistan, she also reached out to disease-stricken African nations and tirelessly advocated for women in the Middle East and dissidents in Burma. She championed programs to get kids out of gangs and to stop urban violence. And she was a major force in rebuilding Gulf Coast schools and libraries post-Katrina. Movingly, she writes of her visits with U.S. troops and their loved ones, and of her empathy for and immense gratitude to military families.\n\nWith deft humor and a sharp eye, Laura Bush lifts the curtain on what really happens inside the White House, from presidential finances to the 175-year-old tradition of separate bedrooms for presidents and their wives to the antics of some White House guests and even a few members of Congress. She writes with honesty and eloquence about her family, her public triumphs, and her personal tribulations. Laura Bush's compassion, her sense of humor, her grace, and her uncommon willingness to bare her heart make this story revelatory, beautifully rendered, and unlike any other first lady's memoir ever written.\n- - - -\n\nFrom the review in the Washington Post, by Ruth Marcus, Sunday, May 2, 2010: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001834.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001834.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Laura has always seemed the more interesting Bush. Certainly, the more mysterious.\n\nWith George W., what you see is what you get. He is not a complicated man. But Laura leaves you wondering about the layers beneath that serene exterior. What is she thinking? What private rebellions are simmering, what resentments submerged? What forged the bond, seemingly as strong as it was unlikely, between the librarian who named her cat Dewey, after the decimal system, and the jock-turned-oilman who was soon to turn, inevitably, to the family business of politics?\n\nLaura Bush's autobiography, &quot;Spoken From the Heart,&quot; begins promisingly enough for anyone hoping to penetrate that surface...\nBut like the West Texas soil, Bush has her limits. She digs only so far. \n[George's] entrance is where &quot;Spoken From the Heart&quot; begins to turn, to close off. Laura spends more time discussing the geology of the Permian Basin than explaining her rapid-fire relationship with George.\n\nAs these spousal memoirs tend to do -- see, for example, Hillary Clinton's &quot;Living History&quot; -- the book becomes less revealing as Bush's life becomes more public. The description of the White House years is more travelogue and recitation of annual holiday themes.&quot;\n\n- - - -\n\n#1 New York Times Bestseller\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec4cbda1d4ad54f40fee3716ed3499dce5cadeb","amp;dn":"SPOKEN+FROM+THE+HEART+-+Laura+Bush.+Read+Laura+Bush+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec4cbda1d4ad54f40fee3716ed3499dce5cadeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,196,203,218,29,74,213,79,64,254,227,113,110,211,73,157,206,92,173,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
