The shooting is shaky and a lot of times it's poorly cropped (I don't care to see that much of the lighting rig, thank you). Mostly wide and medium-range shots, closeups are really shaky for the most part. Picture quality is OK but with a lot of grain. Audio is distant and a little muffled but fairly good. \n\nSetlist:\nDeuce\nKing of the night time world\nDo you love me?\nCalling Dr. Love\nCold gin\nWatchin' you\nFirehouse\nI stole your love\nShock me\nLet me go, rock 'n' roll\nShout it out loud\nI was made for lovin' you\nC'mon and love me\nGod of thunder\nNew York groove\nLove gun\n100,000 years\nBlack diamond\nDetroit rock city\nRock and roll all nite\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f1e50830b0812ca64d5853cbcc410518a070cc","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Rotterdam%2CHolland+10-12-1996+right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f1e50830b0812ca64d5853cbcc410518a070cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,241,229,8,48,176,129,44,166,77,88,83,203,204,65,5,24,160,112,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
