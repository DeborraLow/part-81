It is part of the Halo franchise, and was released on the Xbox 360 video game console on September 22, 2009. Players assume the roles of elite human United Nations Space Command soldiers, known as &quot;Orbital Drop Shock Troopers&quot; or ODSTs, during the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3. There are two modes of play: in the game's campaign mode, players explore the ruined city of New Mombasa to discover what happened to their missing teammates in the midst of an alien invasion. In the &quot;Firefight&quot; multiplayer option, players battle increasingly difficult waves of enemies to score points and survive as long as possible; the Halo 3 multiplayer experience is contained on a separate disc packaged with ODST.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340629e927b40146bcb7b30fc459b6e082c049bb","amp;dn":"HALO%3A+ODST-XBOX360%5BREGIONFREE%5D+-+RespawnGames","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340629e927b40146bcb7b30fc459b6e082c049bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,6,41,233,39,180,1,70,188,183,179,15,196,89,182,224,130,192,73,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
