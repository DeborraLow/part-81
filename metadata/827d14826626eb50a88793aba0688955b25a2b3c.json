Three years in the making and delayed by numerous creative shifts both in direction and production, the London four piece are back to unleash their new sounds on the Reading and Leeds crowd.\n\nLoved for their 2007 Mercury Prize winning album Myths of the Near Future and hit single Golden Skans, Klaxons slap neon sheen on their captivating melodies. New single Echoes shows what they do best.
