Their lack of funds is compounded by problems ranging from small (cheating girlfriends, mothers in sleazy movies) to large (the towering presence of Tunde, the local porn king). They come up with various schemes, each more harebrained than the last--stealing library books, breaking and entering, dognapping--all with a spectacular lack of success. And into the bargain, they've fallen foul of drugs baron, Jesus (Gary Kemp), whose slogan is &quot;You've gotta have faith in Jesus&quot;.\n\nFirst Upload From Me\n\nPlease Seed !!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00c3237cd485be8f911921e604316428fd72849","amp;dn":"Dog+Eat+Dog+%5BDVD%5D+%5B2001%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00c3237cd485be8f911921e604316428fd72849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,12,50,55,205,72,91,232,249,17,146,30,96,67,22,66,143,215,40,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
