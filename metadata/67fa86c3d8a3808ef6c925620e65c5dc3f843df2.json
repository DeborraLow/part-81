It was released as the fourth single from the album in November 1984 and peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Adult Contemporary chart in February 1985.\n\nThe video for &quot;Foolish Heart&quot; is unique in the fact that it is one continuous shot from beginning to end. The setting is a darkened hall with the camera overlooking a balcony rail towards the stage. On the stage, in a spotlight, is a boom mic and a stool. Perry walks onto the stage, sits and the song begins. Over the course of the video, the camera pans towards the stage, pauses a brief moment on Perry and then slowly returns to its original position over the balcony rail. At the end of the song, Perry walks off stage.\n\nStreet Talk is Steve Perry's first solo album, released in April, 1984.\n\nStreet Talk contains Perry's biggest hit as a solo artist, &quot;Oh Sherrie&quot;, written for his then-girlfriend Sherrie Swafford. The song hit #1 on the Billboard charts and the accompanying music video (also featuring Swafford) was a hit on MTV. Other singles included &quot;Foolish Heart&quot; (peaked at #18), &quot;She's Mine&quot; (peaked at #21), and &quot;Strung Out&quot; (peaked at #40).\n\nThere were a number of nods to Perry's pre-Journey band Alien Project on this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in fact, that band was originally going to be called Street Talk. In the liner notes, Perry dedicates the album to Richard Michaels (the bassist for Alien Project). Also, drummer Craig Krampf was a member of Alien Project later in the 1970s.\n\nStreet Talk is certified as 2x Platinum (2,000,000) in sales by the RIAA.\n\nIt is one of the first albums Next Plateau Entertainment has distributed.\n\nSteve Perry (born Stephen Ray Perry; January 22, 1949) is an American singer and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist of the band Journey from 1978ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1987 and 1995ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1998.
