The style progresses from simple sample house tracks, to more complicated synth tracks. There is a clear difference between the quality of the mixes and i'll admit Disc 2 definitely the best, but it shows the evolution of me as a producer and i'm proud of all of 'em! I think I had more fun on the simple ones anyway ;)\n\nAll tracks recorded in 320kbps LAME mp3\nSome tracks (specifically from disc 1) have been remastered from mono.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n:Disc 1:\n\n01 - The House Crew - All We Wanna Do Is Dance (Funk vs Acid Mix)\n02 - Modjo - Lady (Beach Love Mix)\n03 - Ruffneck - Everybody Be Somebody (Smooth Funk Mix)\n04 - Phoenix- If I Ever Feel Better (Cyber Edit)\n05 - Beastie Boys - Intergalactic (Digital Inferno Mix)\n06 - Room 5 feat Oliver Cheatham - Make Luv (Soulful Retouch Mix)\n07 - Mint Royale - Sexiest Man In Jamaica (Began in Jamaica Mix)\n08 - Danny Tenaglia - Elements (Dark 'n' Dirty Mix)\n09 - Daft Punk - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (Cyber Funky Mix)\n10 - Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious 5 - The Message (Groove Control Mix)\n11 - Madonna - Deeper &amp; Deeper (Electro-pop mix)\n\n:Disc 2:\n\n01 - Cassius - The Sound of Violence (Computer Love Remix)\n02 - New Order - Crystal (Heavy Mix)\n03 - Chromeo - Me And My Man (2007 Mix)\n04 - New Order - Jetstream (Take Off Mix)\n05 - The Automatic - Monster (Robot Revamp)\n06 - NYPC - The Bomb (Dirty Electro Pop Mix)\n07 - Major Lazer - Pon De Floor (Robot J's Mix)\n08 - Amp Live Feat.
