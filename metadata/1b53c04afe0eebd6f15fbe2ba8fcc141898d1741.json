Since July 31, 2010, Barcelona Metro system consists of 11 lines with 164 stations and 124 km in total. In 2002 ATM announced that two additional lines would built in the near future, L12 and L13.[3] There have been 3 driverless lines since 2009: Line 11, Line 9 and Line 10, in chronological order.\n\nThe Barcelona Metro was founded in 1924 with the construction of the Gran Metro between Lesseps and the PlaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a de Catalunya, part of the modern Line 3. Two years later the Metro Transversal (now part of Line 1) was built between the PlaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a de Catalunya and la Bordeta to link the city centre with the PlaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a d\\'Espanya and MontjuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯c, the site of the 1929 Universal Exhibition.\n\nToday the network consists of ten lines managed by 2 different operators: Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), which manages the major underground lines; and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC, or Catalan Government Railways), which manages three integrated commuter lines running out into the extended metropolitan area. Fares are integrated into Autoritat del Transport MetropolitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â , a city-wide system that also includes local and regional buses and some regional train services. 98% of its railway tracks are subsurface.\n\nThe metro network proper, operated by TMB, consists of eight lines, numbered L1 to L5 and L9 to L11, and distinguished on network maps by different colours. FGC lines are numbered L6, L7 and L8. None of the Barcelona Metro lines have a name of their own but are generally referred to by their colour or by the number and the names of their termini. The Funicular de MontjuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯c, a funicular railway, is fare-integrated and listed on maps as part of the metro network, being connected directly to the metro at ParalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·lel station.\n\n=====================================\n\nPreview:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAhDlAAdP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAhDlAAdP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eahdmaAdp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eahdmaAdp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAHdNaadP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAHdNaadP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAHdpAAdp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAHdpAAdp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b53c04afe0eebd6f15fbe2ba8fcc141898d1741","amp;dn":"Barcelona+Metro+%2F+Metro+de+Barcelona+%28Bart+Omeu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b53c04afe0eebd6f15fbe2ba8fcc141898d1741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,83,192,74,254,14,235,214,241,95,190,43,168,252,193,65,137,141,23,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
