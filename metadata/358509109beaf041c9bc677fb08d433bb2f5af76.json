They were definitely one\n  of my favorites when their Asian Man Debut came out in 2000, and their music\n  still means a lot to me today. It's got that Tim guy from Rise Against and Dan\n  and Rob from the Broadways. Now that's a good band. Anyways, these records are\n  remastered and this is the first time the demo has been on CD.\n\n  &quot;You can hire 100 slaves to build your house for you, or you can utilize your\n  own tooooools!\n  These Nails can build anything we want them to, let's build a place where we\n  can choose\n  The Life We're Living.&quot; -The Honor System: Slaves\n\n  FNT: 9 years of spreading anarchist views!\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
