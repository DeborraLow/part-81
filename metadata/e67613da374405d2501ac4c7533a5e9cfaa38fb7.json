The Visitors claim to only need a small amount of Earth's resources, in exchange for which they will share their advanced technological and medical knowledge. As a small number of humans begin to doubt the sincerity of the seemingly benevolent Visitors, FBI counter-terrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) discovers that the aliens have spent decades infiltrating human governments, businesses, and religious institutions and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the Earth. Erica joins the resistance movement, which includes Ryan (Morris Chestnut), a Visitor sleeper agent  who over time developed human emotions and now wants to save humanity. The Visitors have won favor among the people of Earth by curing a variety of diseases, and have recruited Earth's youth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ including Erica's son Tyler (Logan Huffman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to serve them unknowingly as spies.\n\n\nV is an American science fiction television series first broadcast on ABC on November 3, 2009. A re-imagining of the 1983 miniseries created by Kenneth Johnson, the new series chronicles the arrival on Earth of a technologically advanced alien species which ostensibly comes in peace, but actually has sinister motives.[3] V stars Morena Baccarin, Morris Chestnut, Joel Gretsch, Charles Mesure, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Scott Wolf, and is executive produced by Scott Rosenbaum, Yves Simoneau, Scott Peters, and Jace Hall. The series is produced by The Scott Peters Company, HDFilms and Warner Bros. Television. On May 13, 2010, ABC renewed V for a second season. A return date has not been confirmed, though it is speculated to return in November.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67613da374405d2501ac4c7533a5e9cfaa38fb7","amp;dn":"V+Season+1+Complete+TeaM+RCP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67613da374405d2501ac4c7533a5e9cfaa38fb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,118,19,218,55,68,5,210,80,26,196,199,83,58,94,156,250,163,143,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
