The project is being funded, in part, by 1,000 fans who paid $45 for the deluxe edition of the album before it was even recorded (theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get a second disc with 15 outtakes). The experience of working with a band again, Cole writes, was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrewarding, perplexing, fabulously enjoyable and heinously stressful.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He adds that, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSinging with a rock and roll band in the studio I felt exactly as I did in 1987 or 1995, and then I would see my reflection in the glass of the gobo and wonder who this old guy wasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nCole is planning to do press for the album in Europe in July and September and play solo dates during those trips; heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also working to schedule a European tour with the Small Ensemble in October and November, plus heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tentatively planning to play shows throughout the U.S. and Australia/New Zealand in early 2011.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ea47662fa6c1a184a225e074a59be309b4d9fd","amp;dn":"Lloyd+Cole+-+Broken+Record+%5Bmp3-192-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ea47662fa6c1a184a225e074a59be309b4d9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,234,71,102,47,166,193,161,132,162,37,224,116,165,155,227,9,180,217,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
