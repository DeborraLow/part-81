Luis Gutierrez: Obama Has Discretionary Authority to Advance DREAM Act, Humane Immigration Reform\n\nSenate Democrats have reintroduced the DREAM Act for the first time since Republicans blocked its passage late last year. Under the measure, immigrant youth would obtain permanent residency with a chance for citizenship, provided they attend college for at least two years or enlist in the U.S. military. The move comes one day after President Obama delivered a major address on immigration reform. We speak to Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, chair of the Immigration Taskforce of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\n\n- &quot;They Are Violating All The Rules&quot;: Rep. Luis Gutierrez Calls for Public Hearings, Impact Studies Into Massive Gas Pipeline for Puerto Rico\n\nDemocratic Rep. Luis Guitierrez of Illinois comments on the Puerto Rican government's push for a 92-mile natural gas pipeline dubbed the &quot;Via Verde,&quot; or &quot;Green Way,&quot; despite concerns that it will cut through forests and water systems, and pass near schools and residential areas. Geologists have noted the pipeline is near earthquake faults where there have been 2,500 seismic events in the last 3 years. Guitierrez says additional public inquiry is needed before the project should be approved and has asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to freeze construction until inquiries and impact assessments can be conducted. &quot;We need hearings, public participation,&quot; says Guitierrez. &quot;Once you destroy the natural habitat of Puerto Rico, it is not something you can recuperate.&quot;\n\n\n- Spanish Judge Baltasar GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n on Bin Laden's Killing, Holding Torturers Accountable, Universal Jursidiction, and His Threatened Ouster From the Bench\n\nCiting the doctrine of Universal Jurisdiction, Spanish judge Baltasar GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n has used the Spanish courts to investigate cases of torture, war crimes and other offenses around the world. In 1998, he ordered the arrest of former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, a move that led to Pinochet's arrest and detention in Britain. In 2003, GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n indicted Osama bin Laden and dozens of other members of Al Qaeda. GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n later attempted to indict six high-ranking members of the Bush administration for their role in authorizing torture at the U.S. military prison at GuantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡namo Bay and overseas before the case was eventually dropped under U.S. pressure. While GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n has long been one of the world's most feared judges, he is now facing his own legal battle. Last year he was indicted for exceeding his authority for launching an investigation into the disappearance of more than 100,000 civilians at the hands of supporters of Gen. Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. GarzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n was suspended as a judge in May 2010 and is facing three separate trials.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31f7e29c794dc82106127fc8d41a247c8de6d4df","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+12+may+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31f7e29c794dc82106127fc8d41a247c8de6d4df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,247,226,156,121,77,200,33,6,18,127,200,212,26,36,124,141,230,212,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
