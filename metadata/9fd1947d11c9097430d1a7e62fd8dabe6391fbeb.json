His thought was born in the hole of solitary confinement, apart from time and beyond the grasp of society. In his cell, he created his own world and speaks his own language: he has concluded that there is only the mind. This DVD will relinquish to you the extreme story of the killer of all killers: Charles Manson. From convincing his followers to move into the desert to train for the apocalypse, to leading a murderous crew through a string of devilish murders, you will see and hear from Manson himself of how he created a preconceived terror based on his philosophy of life. Manson claims that the so-called 'straight' world outside of prison is but an inverted reflection of the underworld in which he has lived.\n\nDetails\n\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 17 September 2002 (USA)\nFilming Locations:\nDeath Valley National Park, California, USA\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co: Holywood Productions, Video Werewolf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fd1947d11c9097430d1a7e62fd8dabe6391fbeb","amp;dn":"Charles+Manson+-+Superstar.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fd1947d11c9097430d1a7e62fd8dabe6391fbeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,209,148,125,17,201,9,116,48,209,167,230,47,216,218,190,99,145,251,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
