We had the honor of working with producer, fiddler and multi-instrumentalist, Tim Carbone (of Railroad Earth) and Phil Nicolo at Studio 4 in Philly who mixed and mastered the songs. Phil is a Grammy-Award-winning producer and engineer who has worked with an impressively long list of top performers. \n\nHere's what Phil had to say about the album: &quot;I was pleasantly surprised to discover The Ragbirds new album to be a wonderful combination of clever songwriting and heartfelt performances. This will live in my CD player for a long while!&quot; \n\nMade from Eco-Friendly packaging, designed with a plastic tray made out of recycled plastic bottles, and printed with vegetable based inks. Each CD saves 6 plastic water bottles from being thrown in a landfill!\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/06/02/the-ragbirds/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/06/02/the-ragbirds/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aed8532a9e57007c3a0d8bb8c7c0c246f2fb19e","amp;dn":"The+Ragbirds...Finally+Almost+Ready%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aed8532a9e57007c3a0d8bb8c7c0c246f2fb19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,237,133,50,169,229,112,7,195,160,216,187,140,124,12,36,111,47,177,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
