Sergeant Keroro) is a manga series by Mine Yoshizaki It was serialized into a TV anime series with the same name directed by Junichi Sato.\nKeroro Gunso is a series about a group of aliens led by Sergeant Keroro that is tasked by the army of Planet Keron to prepare Earth for their invasion. However, the platoon of five ends up being friends with humans in Inner Tokyo, and their plans of invasion stuck up indefinitely.\n\nThe series takes its comedy from a combination of wordplay (particularly puns and homophones), physical humor, situational humor, and numerous pop culture references (especially to Gundam, Space Battleship Yamato and Neon Genesis Evangelion). Various anime, games, manga, and other aspects of pop culture are parodied/referenced throughout the series as a bonus to older viewers. Both the manga and the anime are laden with pop-culture references, and even in the same story the references often vary wildly.\n\nBoth the manga and the anime focus on the steadily deteriorating conditions of the Keroro Platoon, a group of frog-like invaders from the planet Keron, whose mission is to conquer Earth (Pekopon). But when their cover is blown, his battalion abandons him and he ends up in the home of the Hinata family. The platoon's leader, Sergeant Keroro, is easily distracted, and would spend his time making Gundam models, watching anime, surfing the Internet and other stuff rather than coming up with a plan to conquer Earth. Aside from Keroro's laziness, what most stands in the way of their mission is the Hinata Family, a trio of humans who keep Keroro busy with ridiculous demands and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter Natsumi.\n\nThe transfer from manga to anime is somewhat uneven, as some episodes strongly resemble the manga while others only borrow the basic story or even use it only as a starting point.\nIn the manga, Earth is referred to as 'Pokopen', whereas in the anime, it is 'Pekopon'.\nWhereas the manga is somewhat oriented towards teens, the anime is toned down to a level acceptable for children.\nKeroro possesses the Kero Ball in the manga, but Fuyuki has it in the anime.\nBecause Giroro, Kururu, and especially Dororo are introduced in the anime much earlier than in the manga, several storylines not featuring them at all were modified to include them.\nBecause of the time difference between the manga's start and the anime's Start, Angol Mois's backstory is somewhat modified. Everything up to the point of Mois telling Nostradamus about her destroying Earth was true but she ended up being five years too late (2004 instead of 1999).\n623 still has his radio show in the anime, but he is a student in Natsumi's class instead of a high school dropout, and his last name is Saburo rather than Hojo.\nIn the anime, Sumomo is a hit intergalactic pop star who appears in several episodes, while in the manga she is a female alien who appears in a bonus issue.\nDororo and Koyuki live in a house next to the Hinata's in the manga, whereas in the anime, they live in the woods near Momoka's estate and can see the Nishizawa tower from their home.\nDue to the anime being much farther ahead than the manga, several episodes have been added that are not in the manga.\n\nKeroro Movie 5 was made in 2010, and its another comedy/epic tale of Keroro! :D Enjoy!\n\n********I upload non-fake torrents, at your pleasure********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f50230a7fa665cc5479ea619b49be64bcdbb596","amp;dn":"Keroro+Movie+5+-+2010+MPEG4+-+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f50230a7fa665cc5479ea619b49be64bcdbb596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,80,35,10,127,166,101,204,84,121,234,97,155,73,190,100,188,219,181,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
