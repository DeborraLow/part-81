Today, we are privileged to\nbring our listeners a brand spanking new Silvercord album, with all new pieces\nnever before heard and never before made available anywhere. And what a\nbreathtaking treat we have in store.\n\nFans of Earth Mantra will know that we hold the music of Silvercord in very high\nesteem indeed, having praised it as some of the best ambient space music we have\never heard at any level. Happily, we can report that &quot;Cronosleeps&quot; not only\nlives up to Geoff's extraordinarily high standards, but brings a fresh new\ndimension to his rapturous musical point of view that elevates the bar even\nfurther.\n\nGeoff Nostrant has always focused his art on the most uplifting and divine\nsounds imaginable, the kind of compositions that can unwind the most tense of\npeople and seemingly trigger spontaneous out of body experiences, the kind of\nmusic one would expect to hear in heaven itself. In &quot;Cronosleeps&quot;, one can find\nplenty of celestial music and heavenly sound design, but there is much, much\nmore here to enjoy. Between all of the enchantment and bliss, Geoff has layered\nbroad stretches of subtle reflection, even some sections of somberness and\nintrospection, employing some of the most effective use of dynamics that we have\never heard in ambient music. The compositional strength of this album is simply\nstaggering.\n\nIndeed, where previously Geoff's music always had a strong sense of romance and\necstasy, of sheer joy bursting forth and enveloping the listener, with\n&quot;Cronosleeps&quot; he focuses much more on contemplation, a perhaps more mature\npresentation of not only the happiest of feelings, but all of the emotional\nrichness that makes us human, even the darker and more intense states of being.\nAs a result, his work speaks more deeply and with greater authority than ever\nbefore, grabbing the listener firmly by the shoulders and demanding full\nattention to the astonishing music being shared. Simply put, this is a\nmasterpiece, by any measure one can imagine.\n\nWe never would have thought it possible for Geoff Nostrant to exceed his\nprevious work so completely, and yet with &quot;Cronosleeps&quot; such a conclusion is\ninescapable. Silvercord is surely one of the greatest ambient artists making\nmusic today, and we at Earth Mantra are exceptionally proud to be able to bring\nhis music to our listeners. Certainly one of the top albums of 2010, and in our\nview, nothing less than music for the ages.\n\nAs always, all Earth Mantra releases are available under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license.
