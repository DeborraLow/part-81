I have edited out the  \nmusic played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNOTES: well, at least the webcast went through at the right time, but the quality is still very bad.  By bad I mean the actual sound quality as well as the sounds the web engineer plays come through way too low.  I left some of the stuff in that I would normally edit out just so yall can hear what I'm talking about.  I wonder if this has anything changes related to GBTV.  Regardless, I hope they fix it by Monday!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8e923d6e6c8e55e8a5476b4eba497b664397b8","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-06-10+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8e923d6e6c8e55e8a5476b4eba497b664397b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,142,146,61,110,108,142,85,232,165,71,107,78,186,73,123,102,67,151,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
