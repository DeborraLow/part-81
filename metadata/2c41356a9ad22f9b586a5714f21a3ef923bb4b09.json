He talks about how IMF does business. They go to desperate countries and lend them money and as for repayment they tell the host country to tax their people. Later they demand more money so they go after public properties and services (Bridges, Highways, Water Supply ...) of that country.\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is extracted audio from the Press TV video.
