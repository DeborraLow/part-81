It is a sequel to Lethal Weapon and Lethal Weapon 2, and it is part of the Lethal Weapon film series.\n\n\nI'm too old for this shit!\n\n\n\nLethal Weapon is a 1987 American buddy cop action film, and the first in a series of films, all directed by Richard Donner and starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as a mismatched pair of LAPD detectives, and Gary Busey as their primary adversary. After the first film, the series fell into the action thriller genres, and is generally considered to typify the &quot;buddy cop&quot; plot device.\n\n\n\n\nPLOT\n\nThe film opens with LAPD Sergeants Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) arriving at an evacuated building believed to have a bomb in it. Against orders, they go inside to investigate the bomb. Riggs decides to deactivate the bomb himself instead of waiting for the Bomb Squad to arrive. Unfortunately, he causes the bomb to detonate and the whole building to collapse. This causes them to be demoted to uniform duties, which upsets Murtaugh because he only has seven days until retirement. While on street patrol, the two stumble upon the attempted hijacking of an armored car and successfully put a halt to it, although they only manage to catch one of the two would-be hijackers. For their efforts in stopping the raid, Riggs and Murtaugh are reinstated as Detectives by their superior, Captain Murphy (Kahan). Murphy introduces internal affairs Sergeant Lorna Cole to the two detectives and informs them that the suspect they have in custody from the hijacking is a known associate of former LAPD Lieutenant and suspected arms dealer: Jack Travis (Wilson).\n\nIn the meantime, the other hijacker who escaped is brought before Travis who is conducting a business meeting with mobster Tyrone (Millar) to account for his actions which have led to police heat being focused on Travis' arms business. Travis has his henchman throw the hijacker into a pit and has it filled with cement so as to display to Tyrone what happens to anyone who might double-cross him. Travis then goes to the county lockup, using his still valid Police Badge gains access to the other hijacker, and executes him. Travis is unaware that he has committed this execution on camera, and when Cole and Riggs arrive on the scene, they are able to identify him using the footage.\n\nBack at the precinct Riggs, Murtaugh and Cole are reviewing the footage of the execution when they are interrupted by Leo Getz (Pesci) who has dropped by to visit his two old buddies. When the detectives put the footage on pause to talk to Leo, Leo manages to recognise Travis and tells them where he can be found. A botched attempt to publicly arrest Travis follows, although the detectives believe that they may now have a lead to Travis' arms warehouse. En route to rendezvous with Cole at the warehouse, Murtaugh and Riggs come under fire from Tyrone's thugs. Murtaugh kills one of them, who turns out to be a friend of his son, Darryl. Murtaugh, visibly distraught, stays at the scene and Riggs continues on to meet Cole. At the warehouse, Riggs and Cole are attacked by Travis's henchmen and the two detectives gain the upper hand, secure most of the armament shipment, and the same evening they fall in love. After learning from Rianne that Murtaugh had become withdrawn over the shooting of Darryl, Riggs confronts Murtaugh on his boat and after a tense exchange of words, he helps Murtaugh get over his guilt. At Darryl's funeral, his father implores Murtaugh to catch the man who put the gun in his son's hands. Riggs, Cole and Murtaugh arrest and interrogate Tyrone learning his weapons come from Jack Travis and bust a garage with more people working for Travis.\n\n\n\n\nDISC INFO:\n\nDisc Title:     Lethal
