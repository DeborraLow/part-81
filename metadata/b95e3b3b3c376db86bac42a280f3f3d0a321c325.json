This new film presents Eastwood both at his home and visiting film locations and sites where his movies were created, including the costume department and the Eastwood Scoring Stage on the Warner Bros. lot. Eastwood's candid, intelligent and often humorous interviews about his body of work and the choices he made, along with abundant clips from his movies, come together to form an up-close and personal portrait of one of the great movie icons. The end result is a clear reminder of why Eastwood's career as both a great filmmaker and actor has been so enduring.\n\nThe Eastwood Factor was originally released by Warner Home Video (WHV) earlier this year as part of its Clint Eastwood: 35 Films, 35 Years at Warner Bros. giftset.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95e3b3b3c376db86bac42a280f3f3d0a321c325","amp;dn":"The+Eastwood+Factor+%28VHS%29+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95e3b3b3c376db86bac42a280f3f3d0a321c325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,94,59,59,60,55,109,184,107,172,66,162,128,243,243,208,163,33,195,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
