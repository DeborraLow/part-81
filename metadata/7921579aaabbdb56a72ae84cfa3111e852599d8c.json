Shortly thereafter, the gate is opened but nothing comes \n\nthrough. Then Carter discovers a very low power signal that is slowly building an \n\noverload powerful enough to destroy the Earth.\n\t\n\n\nSeason 6, Episode 2: Redemption: Part 2\n\nAnubis' weapon continues to threaten Earth. Various plans are tried until Jonas \n\nQuinn suggests something simple that just might work. Meanwhile, Master Bra'tac \n\nhas discovered the planet from which Anubis is launching the attack. He, Teal'c \n\nand Rya'c journey there to put a stop to it.\n\t\n\n\nSeason 6, Episode 3: Descent\n\nStargate Command discovers a Goa'uld Ha'tak in Earth orbit. Exploring, they \n\ndiscover it is the ship where Anubis briefly imprisoned Thor. At some point, \n\nAnubis' forces set the self-destruct and abandoned the ship, but something has \n\nhalted the destruction and brought the ship to Earth. Jacob/Selmak opens the \n\ncomputer core so the team may learn more. Then the ship begins to descend towards \n\nEarth. SG-1 must discover what's going on before the destruction of the Ha'tak \n\nthreatens Earth. And hopefully, escape the doomed ship themselves.\n\t\n\n\nSeason 6, Episode 4: Frozen\n\nA team associated with Stargate Command and posted in Antarctica makes an \n\nastounding discovery - a perfectly preserved, apparently human woman who has been \n\nfrozen since the Antarctic Stargate was first deployed. Then they discover she is \n\nstill alive, and work to revive her. But her revival costs the team: they and SG-1 \n\nsuccumb to a deadly disease the woman apparently carries. She can save them but \n\nnot herself. And the effort exhausts her; she may not be able to save everyone \n\nbefore the disease claims her life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7921579aaabbdb56a72ae84cfa3111e852599d8c","amp;dn":"STARGATE.SG-1.S06E01-04.SWESUB.+-Lindoff.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7921579aaabbdb56a72ae84cfa3111e852599d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,33,87,154,170,187,219,86,167,42,232,76,250,49,17,232,82,89,157,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
