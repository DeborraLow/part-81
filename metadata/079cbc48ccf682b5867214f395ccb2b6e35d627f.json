The MPEG Handbook is both a theoretical and practical treatment of the subject. Fundamental knowledge is provided alongside practical guidance eg how to avoid quality loss or the creation of MPEG elementary streams and their multiplexing into transport streams (including the problems involved in synchronizing all of the signals in a multiplex). The clarity of explanation and depth of technical detail combine to make this book an essential and definitive reference work. Gives a comprehensive treatment of significant extensions made available by MPEG4, such as object coding, mesh coding and animation.\n\nPreviously titled MPEG2, the book has now been extensively revised to cover the all the latest standards, including a description of the MPEG4 standard and the latest applications of the technology, such as the delivery of compressed audio, video, graphics and interactive capability over the internet and broadband networks. It gives a comprehensive treatment of significant extensions made available by MPEG4, such as object coding, mesh coding and animation.\n\nJohn Watkinson is an international consultant in audio, video and data recording. He is a Fellow of the AES, a member of the British Computer Society and a chartered information systems practitioner. He presents lectures, seminars, conference papers and training courses worldwide. He is the author of many other Focal Press books, including: the Kraszna-Krausz award winning MPEG-2; The Art of Digital Audio; An Introduction to Digital Video; The Art of Sound Reproduction; An Introduction to Digital Audio; TV Fundamentals and Audio for Television. He is also co-author, with Francis Rumsey, of The Digital Interface Handbook, and contributor to the Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook, 3rd edition.\n\n*Understand the principles of MPEG technology\n*Keep up to date with the main and latest standards - MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG4\n*Shows how MPEG technology can be applied for the best results","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:079cbc48ccf682b5867214f395ccb2b6e35d627f","amp;dn":"MPEG+Handbook+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"079cbc48ccf682b5867214f395ccb2b6e35d627f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,156,188,72,204,246,130,181,134,114,20,243,149,204,178,182,227,93,98,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
