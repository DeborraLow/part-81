He played with some of the all time greats through out his career, and from the founding of his Modern Mambo Quartet in 1954, to his death in 1982, he helped launch the careers of numerous musicians. His music continues to inspire, and have impact on the evolution of Latin music in the US. \nThe 16 tracks presented here are some mighty fine recordings, featuring Cal Tjader on vibes throughout. &quot;Manteca&quot; becomes a sexy weaving of melodies between the flute and vibes, adding depth to this modern classic. &quot;Soul Burst&quot; features an explosion of percussion by congas, timbales and more--while Tito Puente's &quot;Picadillo&quot; is rendered superbly as well. \n\nNot a bad track on the CD, and you will have fun recognizing some of the 60's classic jazz performers that have joined in, including Chick Corea, Donald Byrd, Willie Bobo, and more. ~ Edward Alexander Gerster &quot;miamibooks&quot; ~ Miamibooks\n\nPersonnel includes:\nCal Tjader (vibraphone);\nOliver Nelson, Chico O'Farrill, Stan Applebaum (conductor, arranger);\nEddie Palmieri (arranger, piano);\nClaus Ogerman (arranger);\nWillie Bobo (vocals, percussion);\nJimmy Heath (tenor saxophone);\nDonald Byrd (trumpet);\nJulian Priester, Jose Rodriguez, Mark Weinstein (trombone);\nGeorge Castro (flute, percussion);\nSeldon Powell, Jerry Dodgion, Paul Horn (flute);\nChick Corea, Lonnie Hewitt, Al Zulaica, Clare Fischer, Joao Donato (piano);\nDick Hyman (organ);\nAttila Zoller, Kenny Burrell (guitar);\nBobby Rodriguez, Al McKibbon, Stan Gilbert, John Hilliard, Freddy Schreiber, Bob Bushnell, Richard Davis, Red Mitchell, George Duvivier (bass);\nTommy Lopez, Manny Oquendo, Grady Tate, Johnny Rae, Carl Burnett, Ed Thigpen (drums);\nArmando Peraza (percussion, bongo);\nRay Barretto (conga, percussion);\nBarry Rogers, Patato Valdez, Wilfredo Vincente, Bill Fitch (conga);\nJose Mangual (timbale);\nIsmail Quintana, Victor Pantoja, Alberto Valdes (percussion);\n\nCal Tjader - Roots Of Acid Jazz Tracks:\n01  Los Jibaros \n02  Manteca \n03  Samba Do Suenho \n04  Mambo in Miami \n05  Triste \n06  Soul Burst \n07  Los Bandidos \n08  Soul Sauce :: Guachi Guaro  \n09  Picadillo \n10  Maramoor Mambo \n11  Insight \n12  Tokyo Blues \n13  Afro-Blue   \n14  Cuando, Cuando, Que Sera? \n15  Cal's Bluedo \n16  Fuji ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f481e4d7d873f9c216454cf04234894fe73c55","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Roots+Of+Acid+Jazz+%281961-67%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f481e4d7d873f9c216454cf04234894fe73c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,244,129,228,215,216,115,249,194,22,69,76,240,66,52,137,79,231,60,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
