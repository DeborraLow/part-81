It is the closing song from the movie Rattle and Hum.\n\nDirector Meiert Avis shot the promotional video in the town of Ostia, outside Rome  on 18 April 1989. Written by Barry Devlin, the video takes an unusual cinematic approach to the song, with U2 band members making only brief cameo appearances. The video tells the story of a dwarf (played by Paolo Risi) who falls in love with a trapeze artist (played by Paola Rinaldi), one of whom apparently dies towards the end. While there is disagreement amongst fans about exactly who has died, The Edge was quoted as saying it is the trapeze artist who dies. This video pays homage to Fellini, who, synchronistically, was shooting his last movie, &quot;La Voce Della Luna&quot; only a few miles away from the U2 set, and also to Tod Browning's 1932 film Freaks.\n\n&quot;All I Want Is You&quot; was played at almost every date of 1989's Lovetown Tour, occasionally seguing into &quot;Bad&quot;, with which it shares considerable musical similarity. It has since been featured in some capacity at every subsequent tour. On the Zoo TV Tour in 1992 and 1993, it was usually merely a snippet at the end of &quot;Bad&quot;, but occasionally Bono would perform a solo abbreviated version. The version played on 1997's PopMart Tour was much more complete, and subsequent live performances have been of the entire song. During its performance on 2001's Elevation Tour, it would segue into &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;. Another version was eventually played on their Vertigo Tour, in the usual place of &quot;Miracle Drug&quot;. The song also closed some shows of the 4th leg, in South America, and finally closed the tour in Honolulu, on 9 December 2006.\n\n&quot;All I Want Is You&quot; was released in the UK as a single on 13 June 1989. The B-Sides featured covers of the Righteous Brothers', &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, and a cover of Love Affair's &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;. It reached #4 in the UK charts and #2 in Australia, #12 on the Dutch Top 40, but only reached #83 in the North American charts. It appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film Reality Bites. The popularity of the song in the film led to a re-release in 1994 where it reached #38 in the US Top 40 Mainstream charts. The single was rereleased in the Netherlands with &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; now being the a-side. Everlasting Love reached number 10 in the Dutch Charts, in January 1990. In 2004, it was ranked #9 in Entertainment Weekly's list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Love Songs&quot;.\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe2f67cbcd07a2f8bff7b22ea0ca5b507fefe93","amp;dn":"U2+-+All+I+Want+Is+You+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe2f67cbcd07a2f8bff7b22ea0ca5b507fefe93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,226,246,124,188,208,122,47,139,255,123,34,234,12,165,181,7,254,254,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
