Taken from Same Old Story's debut album A Great\n  Disgrace the intent is clear, not just to play great powerful melodic pop-punk\n  but also to give us a message that there is one world and we need to look\n  after it. This release has been a while in coming and the band have had time\n  to develop it before the recording. They are touring now around the UK and\n  Europe with Misconduct and ripping things up in the style of Millencolin,\n  Green Day and Rise Against. This new CD, supported by a new video and tour,\n  will not disappoint you.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
