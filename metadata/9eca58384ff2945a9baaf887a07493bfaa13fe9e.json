Set in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, where &quot;summers span decades and winters can last a lifetime,&quot; Game of Thrones chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the kingdom's noble families for control of the Iron Throne; as the series opens, additional threats from the snow and ice covered region north of Westeros and from the eastern continent across a narrow sea are simultaneously beginning to rise.\n\n\n\n* Production\n\n* Conception and development\n\nThe series began development in January 2007. HBO, after acquiring the rights to the novels with the intent of turning them into an international cable television series, hired David Benioff and D. B. Weiss to write and executive produce the series, which would cover one novel's worth of material per season. Initially, it was planned that Benioff and Weiss would write every episode save one per season, which author and co-executive producer George R. R. Martin was attached to write. However, Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to each write one episode of the first season.\n\n&quot;The Sopranos in Middle-earth&quot; is the tagline Benioff jokingly suggested for the television adaptation, referring to its intrigue-filled content and dark tone set in a fantasy world setting.Traditional high fantasy is described as generally incidental to the series, with HBO programming chief Michael Lombardo finding the storytelling appealing rather than the low-key magic or the exotic milieu, in spite of the network's new developmental policy to &quot; shots at shows that we wouldn't have taken a shot at five years ago.&quot;\n\nThe Game of Thrones's budget has been compared to that of Rome.The pilot reportedly cost HBO between US$5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“10 million, and the total budget for the first season has been estimated at US$50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“60 million.\n\nHBO hired expert language creator David J. Peterson from the Language Creation Society to develop the Dothraki language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;possessing its own unique sound, extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and complex grammatical structure&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to be used in the series. The first and second drafts of the pilot script, written by Benioff and Weiss, were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008, respectively. While HBO found both drafts to their liking, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008, with the 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process.\n\n\n* Casting\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced that Peter Dinklage had been signed on to star as Tyrion Lannister in the pilot, and that Tom McCarthy was set to direct. Shortly thereafter, pranksters at the Internet Movie Database edited the IMDb profile of actress Holly Marie Combs to indicate that she had been cast as Catelyn Stark; however, producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss confirmed this was a hoax. A few months later, in the beginning of August, it was revealed that Catelyn would be portrayed by Jennifer Ehle.\n\nOn July 19, 2009, a number of further casting decisions were announced, including Sean Bean being given the role of Ned Stark, thus confirming a rumour first reported a couple of days before.Other actors signed on for the pilot were Kit Harington in the role of Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon.\n\nOn August 20, several more casting announcements were made, featuring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys Targaryen, as well as Richard Madden in the role of Robb Stark, Iain Glen as Ser Jorah Mormont, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, and Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams as Sansa and Arya Stark, respectively. On September 1, it was revealed that Lena Headey had been cast as Cersei Lannister.On September 23, Martin confirmed that Rory McCann has been cast as Sandor Clegane.Isaac Hempstead-Wright was confirmed as Bran Stark on October 14, followed by an announcement of Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo three days later.\n\nAfter the pilot was shot and the series picked up, it was announced that the role of Catelyn had been recast, with Michelle Fairley replacing Ehle. Later, it was also confirmed that Emilia Clarke would replace Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys.\n\nThe casting process for season 2 began in May 2011.\n\n\n\n* Filming locations\n\nPrincipal photography for the first season of the series was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010, with the primary locations being the Paint Hall Studio in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and the city of Mdina, Malta, a change in location from Morocco. For the initial shooting of the pilot in 2009, additional filming locations included Carncastle, Shane's Castle, Castle Ward, Magheramorne, and Tollymore Forest Park, all in Northern Ireland. Doune Castle in central Scotland was also used.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011 * ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eca58384ff2945a9baaf887a07493bfaa13fe9e","amp;dn":"GAME+OF+THRONES+-+SEASON+1+flv+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eca58384ff2945a9baaf887a07493bfaa13fe9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,202,88,56,79,242,148,90,155,170,248,135,160,116,147,191,170,19,254,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
