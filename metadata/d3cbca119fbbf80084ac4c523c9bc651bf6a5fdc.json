Two thousand years of everyday currency history was overthrown overnight as the country woke up to \\&quot;new money\\&quot; on February 15th 1971 and said goodbye to coins such as the crown, the florin and the shilling.\n\nFew economic events have affected the entire country so immediately and Peter Day delves into the archives to examine how the country prepared for and responded to D Day. It was Harold Wilson\\'s Labour government that began the process of decimalisation in the 1960s after many years of discussion. Then cabinet minister Tony Benn recalls how changing Britain\\'s money fitted in with the modernising ideology of the time, while former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Dick Taverne remembers the passion of the \\&quot;Save our Sixpence\\&quot; campaign.\n\nEconomists Peter Jay and Will Hutton discuss whether decimalisation contributed to the double-digit inflation of the 1970s alongside archive stories of price rises and \\&quot;rounding up\\&quot;, as earnest commentators worried about how \\'the housewife\\' would cope. Did we lose something, culturally and intellectually, when we embraced new money?\n\nOxford Professor of Mathematics Marcus du Sautoy considers whether \\&quot;thinking in tens\\&quot; is really the best way to go about things. And Peter visits The Kings\\' Head pub in North London where the landlord\\'s tills charged in pounds, shillings and pence for some three decades after D-Day. He also talks to Sir Patrick Moore - patron of the Metric Martyrs campaign - about his love of imperial measures.\n\nBritain may have been successful in decimalising its currency in 1971 but why was the movement towards full metrication - begun at the same time - never completed? Finally Peter asks, if you\\'re old enough to remember, is it still possible to think in \\&quot;old money\\&quot;?\n\nProducers: Simon Jacobs and Phil Smith\nA Unique production for BBC Radio 4.\n\n\nDecimal Day - What\\'s That In Old Money \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 57mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don\\'t have time to keep trying.\nIf it\\'s down then it\\'s skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don\\'t miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\nI often get asked to recommend some comedy.
