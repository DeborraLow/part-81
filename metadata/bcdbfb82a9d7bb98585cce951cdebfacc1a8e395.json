It was first recorded by Aaron Neville, who released the song as a single in 1966. It was issued at the end of the year on the Par-Lo label and became a hit, peaking at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in early 1967.\n\nIn 2004, it was ranked #381 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nTracy Chapman and Lightnin' Hopkins composed songs with the same name not to be confused with Davis and Diamond's version discussed here.\n\nIn 1980, &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot; was covered by Heart and became a top-ten hit in the U.S., peaking at #8 (becoming Heart's highest-charting single at the time).\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington, USA in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity by the mid-1980s, the band created a major comeback  in 1985, experiencing further success with their power ballads throughout the rest of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Heart left their 1980s' sound and went back to their hard rock roots which they continue to play today. To date, Heart has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, Heart will return with a new studio recording on August 31 2010, entitled Red Velvet Car.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\nLittle Queen, with the hit &quot;Barracuda&quot; (#11, 1977), became Heart's second million-seller. Ann and Nancy appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in July 1977 (issue No. 244).\n\nMagazine was re-issued in early 1978, peaking in the top twenty and gave forth the hit single &quot;Heartless&quot;. In late 1978, the double-platinum Dog and Butterfly followed suit. After the 77-city &quot;Dog and Butterfly&quot; tour, the Wilson-Fisher liaisons ended. Roger left the band in the fall of 1979 after having a breakdown on stage and throwing a guitar near Nancy's head backstage. Michael was no longer their manager and left Ann for another woman. Roger Fisher formed his own band in the Seattle area. Longtime guitarist Howard Leese and Nancy filled the guitar slack and her childhood friend Sue Ennis helped with song collaborations. Heart then released Bebe le Strange in 1980. It became the band's second top ten hit album and produced two hit singles. By the end of the year, the band scored their highest charted single at the time; a remake of the ballad &quot;Tell it Like it Is&quot; which peaked at #8.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcdbfb82a9d7bb98585cce951cdebfacc1a8e395","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Tell+It+Like+It+Is+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcdbfb82a9d7bb98585cce951cdebfacc1a8e395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,219,251,130,169,215,187,152,88,92,206,149,28,222,191,172,193,168,227,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
