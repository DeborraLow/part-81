Their life of crime soon involves Linda, too, as they need money for a lawyer (Lenny's charlatan grandpa Ron, whose trophy wife is the ex-girlfriend of Brian, Linda's latest lover). When Ron fails Mike, Linda decides to send Mike to private college, so she needs more money. After Brian gives them a tip on cash at Mr. Snack, a fast food joint, it's robbery time. Then there's Suzi and Suzy, young women who work at Mr. Snack and have their eyes on Mike and Lenny. Is there a ticket out of the trailer park?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b820b11fd9c60248a4eabb454f94f893f02fb86f","amp;dn":"Poor+White+Trash+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b820b11fd9c60248a4eabb454f94f893f02fb86f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,32,177,31,217,198,2,72,164,234,187,69,79,148,248,147,240,47,184,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
