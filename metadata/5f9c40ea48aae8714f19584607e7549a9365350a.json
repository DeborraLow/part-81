There is usually enough time to change the boot setting back to boot on the OS X.6.7 disk before it fails\n\nComment 3: Maybe it's necessary to install this update if another one comes around that says you must have this on installed first. So you may just want to download it and store it somewhere without actually installing it.\n\nJust use common sense, don't let this ruin your MAC experience, at least people that are more familiar with I.T. than I am can see what they are trying to achieve here. \n\n--- BE CAREFUL AND PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9c40ea48aae8714f19584607e7549a9365350a","amp;dn":"Update+for+Mac+OS+X+Lion+Developer+Preview+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9c40ea48aae8714f19584607e7549a9365350a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,156,64,234,72,170,232,113,79,25,88,70,7,231,84,154,147,101,53,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
