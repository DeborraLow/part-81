You know, one of the most imitated punk bands of the last 25 years, beloved by droves of loyal fans, the standard bearer in the independent music scene, among the most influential and often controversial bands of their time, the most widely traveled group around, the authors of countless hit songs. Yeah, them. They've got a prodigious resume to be sure and an extensive catalog to back it up: 11 full length studio albums, 2 live records, 13 EP's, and so many 7in it'll give you a headache trying to remember them all. With so many odds and ends out there, Fat Mike decided it would be nice to cull the majority of their EP's into one release, The Longest EP. A collection of 30 songs, The Longest EP spans NOFX's first Fat Wreck Chords release The PMRC Can Suck on This to their latest Cokie the Clown. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7f31448c1d9c7b225a1d138b084158d12af717","amp;dn":"NOFX+-+The+Longest+EP+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7f31448c1d9c7b225a1d138b084158d12af717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,127,49,68,140,29,156,123,34,90,29,19,139,8,65,88,209,42,247,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
