The game is succeeded by Need for Speed: Carbon, which serves as a sequel to Most Wanted, and later Need for Speed: World, which features both the cities of Rockport and Palmont, making that game a successor to both Most Wanted and Carbon. Most Wanted was a commercial success; it sold nearly 6 million copies worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f576fb48ada05b0ddd6cfcee83c5a20251aef6","amp;dn":"NEED+FOR+SPEED%3A+MOST+WANTED-XBOX360%5BPAL%5D+-+RespawnGames","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f576fb48ada05b0ddd6cfcee83c5a20251aef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,245,118,251,72,173,160,91,13,221,108,252,238,131,197,162,2,81,174,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
