Thomas, young and fit, has been dishonorably discharged from the army. Ali, an affable Turkish businessman, has experienced some hard times but now his primary concern is making...\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 29 min. \n\n&quot;There is nonetheless something haunting about this film, a sense of desperation and defeat that seems less like a generic convention than like a genuine insight.&quot;\n\nA.O. Scott\nNew York Times\n\n\n\nTechnology :\n\nThis is HD DVB-T, and the broadcaster (arte) harcoded the french subtitles on the video. Nothing I can do about that. Mpc-hc displayed other subtitles at the same height over these, which you may like or not (you should have the option to move them as you see fit, if you don't).\n\nVery few and short imperfections because of the reception (which was very good), they should not be a concern.\n\nThis is, as always with current french HD DVB-T, pseudo 1080p. It's interlaced in 25fps, and it actually is 1440x1080 to be displayed in 16:9 (which gets you to 1920x1080, aka 1080p).\n\nThe quality of the encode is great tough, and since The Blu-Ray is out of stock, I guess that's technically the best version you'll find for now.\n\n\n\nSome snapshots:\n\n[url]http://www.phyrefile.com/image/view/AtdyCRltZwLk5CuG][/url]\n\n[url]http://www.phyrefile.com/image/view/tXPMxqBPzujja1kP[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.phyrefile.com/image/view/D9mULxVQP2UyFT8M[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.phyrefile.com/image/view/27gxvXUJsYMsIxua[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.phyrefile.com/image/view/yeeJFSqiJraRIDn1[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5b1723c62879db87e319c2594b9fa8b3103463","amp;dn":"Jerichow-Christian+Petzold-2009.HDTV.H264.1080pish.HardSubsFR.Mu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5b1723c62879db87e319c2594b9fa8b3103463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,91,23,35,198,40,121,219,135,227,25,194,89,75,159,168,179,16,52,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
