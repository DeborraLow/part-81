With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture. Watt was born in Scotland, where he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation. He is the author of the Cutting Through series, including The Androgynous (Hermaphroditic) Agenda, A Glimpse into the Great Work, and Esoteric Unveiled and the Meaning of Revelations in the High Masonic Tradition. Mr. Watt is featured in Alex Jones' film Fall Of The Republic: The Presidency of Barack H. Obama. \n[2nd half of hour 2, all of hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex covers the latest news and also takes calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
