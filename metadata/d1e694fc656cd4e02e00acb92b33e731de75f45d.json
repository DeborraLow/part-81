The show drew a legitimate crowd of 61,470 fans (despite claims of over 74,000) which was an outdoor attendance record at the time. The event set an attendance record for a wrestling show that would not be beaten until WrestleMania III. The event was later released on VHS tape by Coliseum Home Video. Commentary for the event was done by Gorilla Monsoon, Johnny Valiant, and Ernie Ladd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1e694fc656cd4e02e00acb92b33e731de75f45d","amp;dn":"WWF+The+Big+Event++Toronto+CNE+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1e694fc656cd4e02e00acb92b33e731de75f45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,230,148,252,101,108,212,224,46,0,172,185,43,51,231,49,222,117,244,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
