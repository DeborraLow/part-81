We have \nunprecedented access to information; cognitive dissonance is a banner \nheadline in our morning papers and radiates silently from our computer \nscreens. Slipstream, poised between literature and popular culture, \nembraces the dissonance. \n\nThese ambitious stories of visionary strangeness defy the conventions \nof science fiction. Tales by Michael Chabon, Karen Joy Fowler, Jonathan \nLethem, Carol Emshwiller, George Saunders, and others pull the reader \ninto a vivid dreamspace and embrace the knowledge that life today is \nincreasingly surreal. \n\nContents: \n\nIntroduction by John Kessel and Jim Patrick Kelly \n\nAl by Carol Emshwiller \nThe Little Magic Shop by Bruce Sterling \nThe Healer by Aimee Bender \nThe Specialist's Hat by Kelly Link \nLight and the Sufferer by Jonathan Lethem \nSea Oak by George Saunders \nExhibit H: Torn Pages Discovered in the Vest Pocket of an Unidentified Tourist by Jeff VanderMeer \nHell is the Absence of God by Ted Chiang \nLieserl by Karen Joy Fowler \nBright Morning by Jeffrey Ford \nBiographical Notes to &quot;A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-planes&quot; by Benjamin Rosenbaum \nThe God of Dark Laughter by Michael Chabon \nThe Rose in Twelve Petals by Theodora Goss \nThe Lions Are Asleep this Night by Howard Waldrop \nYou Have Never Been Here by M.
