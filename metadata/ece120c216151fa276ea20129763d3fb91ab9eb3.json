Produced with the world's leading orchestras and musicians, told through a 25,000 mile journey along every route Mozart followed, this detective story takes us to the heart of genius.\n\nWithout resorting to docu-drama or visual re-enactment, In Search of Mozart traces the composer's life through his music and extensive correspondence. From K1a to K626 (Requiem), over 80 works are featured in chronological order, revealing striking parallels between the music and Mozart's own experiences. Throughout, it is the music that takes centre stage, with the jigsaw of Mozart's life fitting around it.\n\nWith rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie, a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about Mozart's genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new image, very different from Milos Forman's 'Amadeus'.\n\nIncludes English Subtitle File (srt).\n\nRunning Time: Approx. 2 hours and 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!
