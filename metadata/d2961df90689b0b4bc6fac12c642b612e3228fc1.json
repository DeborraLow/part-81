A band that has a southern drawled singer, so they gotta be from Texas, Louisiana or somewhere nearby. Blazing heavy guitars all over the place with wah-wah, backwards fazing and east/west stereo special effects. Everything you need for psychedelic guitar perfection.\n\nLoose, rural psych/hard rock from 1972 with fluid guitar and masterful organ, produced by Artie Kornfield at A&amp;R in New York. 8 powerful tracks with interplay that is similar to bands like (early) Lynyrd Skynyrd, Trapeze etc. Great songs like &quot;Frolic Child&quot; build from a gentle ballad into a beautiful guitar workout whilst &quot;Trapped in the City&quot; is a 6 minute bluesy workout with excellent phased Hammond work. Nice album.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Patato - 5.13 min\n02. Don't - 4.40 min\n03. The Waiting, E Train Blue - 6.15 min\n04. Trapped In The City - 6.21 min\n05. Eulogy - 3.16 min\n06.
