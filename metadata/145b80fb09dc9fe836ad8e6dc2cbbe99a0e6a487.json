Their 2008 Deadboy Universal      :  ::\n::  :     Records debut album 'From The Oceanic Graves' propelled the     :  ::\n::  :     and to the forefront of the New Zealand metal scene, became a   :  ::\n::  :     label best-seller and secured many loyal fans both at home and  :  ::\n::  :     internationally.                                                :  ::\n\n::  :     Having toured Europe with other acts as well as headlining      :  ::\n::  :     shows in New Zealand and Australia with previous line-ups,      :  ::\n::  :     this year the band's current line-up is due to hit the          :  ::\n::  :     international touring circuit in support of their forthcoming   :  ::\n::  :     release, &quot;Embers In The Spiritless Void&quot;, due out on the 16th   :  ::\n::  :     May 2011.                                                       :  ::\n\n::  :     This sophomore album has taken every sonic element from their   :  ::\n::  :     previous releases and intensified them, making this In Dread    :  ::\n::  :     Response's heaviest and most accomplished work yet. Each song   :  ::\n::  :     is akin to a groundswell of ferocity with Corey Friedlander's   :  ::\n::  :     ceaseless double-kick driven cannon fire being propelled        :  ::\n::  :     forward by Steve Boag's bass onslaught and Sean                 :  ::\n::  :     O'Kane-Connolly's unrestrained lyrical passion delivered in     :  ::\n::  :     his harsh and searing vocals, supported on some songs by a 16-  :  ::\n::  :     strong 'Dread Choir', who add even more intensity to the        :  ::\n::  :     absolute pandemonium. All the while chief songwriter and lead   :  ::\n::  :     guitarist, Trajan Schwencke, offsets the death metal brutality  :  ::\n::  :     with a pleasantly overwhelming maelstrom of organised sound     :  ::\n::  :     delivered through towering guitar solos and heartfelt riffs -   :  ::\n::  :     courtesy of fellow axeman Ross McDougall - which clearly pays   :  ::\n::  :     homage to the legacy of metal's godfathers, albeit with a more  :  ::\n::  :     modern twist.                                                   :  ::\n\n::  :     With an award for best New Zealand metal video already under    :  ::\n::  :     their belts for the single &quot;Cannons at Dawn&quot;, and having        :  ::\n::  :     performed to a crowd of thousands in support of guitar legends  :  ::\n::  :     Slash, Jennifer Batten, and power metal supergroup Hail!,       :  ::\n::  :     featuring Ripper Owens and Scott Travis of the legendary Judas  :  ::\n::  :     Priest, In Dread Response are now set to bring their            :  ::\n::  :     relentless energy and live show to metal fans worldwide. So if  :  ::\n::  :     you haven't started preparing for the impending &quot;Dreadstorm&quot;    :  ::\n::  :     then you better start now as once it hits international shores  :  ::\n::  :     there will be nothing left in its wake but &quot;Embers In The       :  ::\n::  :     Spiritless Void&quot;.                                               :  ::\n\n::  :     :: www.dreadstorm.printmighty.co.nz                             :  ::\n\n.         ::  ANOTHER  ::         .\n::  BLAST F  ::\n.:  ROM THE  :.\n:  -PAST!-  :\n\n:  sP!/2o!  :\n. ...:  cRo2o11  :... .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145b80fb09dc9fe836ad8e6dc2cbbe99a0e6a487","amp;dn":"In+Dread+Response-Embers+In+The+Spiritless+Void-2011-AMX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145b80fb09dc9fe836ad8e6dc2cbbe99a0e6a487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,91,128,251,9,220,159,232,54,173,142,109,194,203,190,153,160,230,164,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
