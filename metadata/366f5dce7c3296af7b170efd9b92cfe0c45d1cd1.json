He sympathetically visits a modern British Health service facility and finds good medicine being practiced but cannot find any evidence that medicines being prescribed  have the slightest effect.

Ontario homeopaths are about to become the first province in Canada to regulate homeopathy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lending credibility to this unproven practice.\n\nCanada's leading consumer ally takes a long hard look at the theories, and the remedies. For the first time in Canada, we conduct a test of homeopathic medicines, investigating the science behind these so-called medicines. \n\nIn light of our results, we ask both the Ontario government and Health Canada why they are lending credibility to the homeopathic industry. Johnson also meets up with a rep from the world's leading manufacturer of homeopathic medicines, who admits that even the company says how homeopathy works is a mystery.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing we learn that some homeopaths are treating cancer patients with homeopathic remedies.
