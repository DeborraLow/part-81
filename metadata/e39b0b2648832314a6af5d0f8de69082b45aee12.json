When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/&lt;/a&gt;\nMOVIEmeter: Up 450% in popularity this week. \nUser Rating:8.1/10 \nGenre:Action | Adventure | Thriller\n\n\n \nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate : 1 060 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 256 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.438\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.265\nStream size : 716 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 86.5 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\nThe Expendables russian video source ............ thanks\nThe Expendables.mp3............OWN\nThe Expendables.srt file ............CLASSiFiED and OWN ,thanks\n\nNOTES:\n\nIMAGiNE bringing you another release..... The Expendables\n\nRight where to start.....well first thing we did was make our own .srt file and hardcoded them .\nThe subtitles are mainly made up of the subs classified did....but they missed a few so we translated them ourselfs.\nFor the subtitles we opted not to blur the russian text but go over it in yellow english subs.\nThe video .....this was a small file with low res and was filmed at a bad angle.....also slightly cropped.\nWell we fixed the angles and then filtered the video changing the contrast,brightness,rgb colours,hue,sharpness and also \nreduced the glares,which in turn makes it a little dull.\nThe audio was nice but very powerful and lots of bass.....so we filtered the audio and lowered the levels...still some distortion on very\nloud scenes but overall very nice line indeed\n\n\nNow just to let users know...the relizlab video seems to be upscaled along with alot of other videos of this popping up....Just incase you wonder\nwhy we have opted for a low res.Well even we have upscaled this,but not too much other wise it looks worse.\nHeres some screens to show you the difference.....\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/20000/19878.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/20000/19878.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e39b0b2648832314a6af5d0f8de69082b45aee12","amp;dn":"The+Expendables+TS+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e39b0b2648832314a6af5d0f8de69082b45aee12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,155,11,38,72,131,35,20,166,175,93,15,141,230,144,130,180,90,238,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
