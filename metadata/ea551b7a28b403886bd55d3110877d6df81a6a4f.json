Having been a big fan of the book and movie for many years, I always felt disappointed that these scenes got cut from the film\\\\\\'s theatrical release. They are funny, poignant and contribute to the narrative of the film. Furthermore, they include awesome cameos by Harold Ramis (as Rob\\\\\\'s father) and Beverly D\\\\\\'Angelo (as a jilted wife). So using Nick Hornby\\\\\\'s novel as guide, I decided to re-insert these deleted scenes into the movie and create an extended cut featuring 12 extra minutes of footage.\n\nI upscaled the original 480p DVD video to 720p prior to encoding in order to try to preserve as much detail as possible from the original DVD transfer, including film grain.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n- ACIZ\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is an unofficial, fan-created edit, and is in no way sponsored or approved by the studio or anybody associated with the film.
