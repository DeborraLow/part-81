You might be wondering what the difference is between a suspense novel and a noir novel. Well, it\\'s just my way of categorizing Williams\\' stories. In the suspense stories the hero finds himself in trouble through no fault of his own and there\\'s always a happy ending. In the noirs, the hero makes his own trouble and the endings are Dantesque--that is, they\\'re like the punishments dished out in Dante\\'s Inferno, always perfectly fitting the crime. In my opinion, the best of these noir stories are Hell Hath No Fury, A Touch of Death, The Big Bite, and Girl Out Back. They make Williams the true heir of James M. Cain, author of The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity.\n\nThe Noirs\n\nHill Girl (1951)\nBig City Girl (1951)\nRiver Girl (1951), also known as The Catfish Tangle\nHell Hath No Fury (1953), also known as The Hot Spot\nNothing in Her Way (October 1953)\nA Touch of Death (October 1954), also known as Mix Yourself a Redhead\nThe Big Bite (1956)\nGirl Out Back (1958), also known as Operator\nAll the Way (September 1958), also known as The Concrete Flamingo\n\nThe Comedies\n\nThe Diamond Bikini (1956)\nThe Wrong Venus (1966), also known as Don\\'t Just Stand There\n\nThe Suspense Novels\n\nGo Home, Stranger (February 1954)\nGulf Coast Girl (1955), also known as Scorpion Reef\nTalk of the Town (1958), also known as Stain of Suspicion\nMan on the Run (1958), also known as Man in Motion\nAground (1960)\nThe Sailcloth Shroud (1960)\nThe Long Saturday Night (March 1962), also known as Finally, Sunday! and Confidentially Yours\nDead Calm (1963)\nAnd the Deep Blue Sea (1971). This one could also be classified as a comedy since it\\'s a spoof of Hollywood movies.\nMan on a Leash (1973)\n\nThe One That Got Away\n\nThe only Williams\\' novel missing from this collection is a comedy, Uncle Sagamore and His Girls (1959)--a book hard to find at a reasonable price, unless you speak French. It\\'s never gone out of print in France. One reviewer said it\\'s funnier than Diamond Bikini. If so, it\\'s very, very funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b76fdc93c01bc7d79493ee7502fe92b550d14e","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+21+Novels+%28epub%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b76fdc93c01bc7d79493ee7502fe92b550d14e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,183,111,220,147,192,27,199,215,148,147,238,117,2,254,146,181,80,209,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
