MacMichael resigned from the CIA in July 1983 because he felt the Agency was misrepresenting intelligence for political reasons. He is a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, founding member of Association of National Security Alumni and the Association for Responsible Dissent, and an outspoken critic of the Iraq War. Mr. MacMichael talks with Alex about the impending attack on Iran. \n[from approx. 3:00 into 2nd half of hour 1, though 1st half of hour 2]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_MacMichael&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_MacMichael&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also talks with Paul Craig Roberts about his article, The Ecstasy of Empire, and his latest book, How the Economy Was Lost: The War of the Worlds.\n[from 3:00 into 2nd half of hour 2, through 14:00 in hour 3]\n\n[I am including .pdf copies of 2 of Dr. Roberts' recent articles, including the one discussed on today's broadcast: &quot;The Ecstacy of Empire.&quot;]\n\n\n\n\n[Ted Anderson -- owner of GCN radio network -- comes on in hour 3 (from 15:00 until the end of the half-hour) to do &quot;live commercial&quot; for his gold business, Midas Resources.]\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
