Frank Sinatra stars as ex-GI Danny Webson Miller, who makes a sentimental journey to the Brooklyn neighborhood where he grew up. Danny moves in with an old pal, high school janitor Nick Lombardi (Jimmy Durante), then inaugurates a romance with music teacher Anne Fielding. He also resolves to turn stuffy uptowner Jamie Shelgrave (Peter Lawford) into a true &quot;son of Flatbush.&quot; The plot thickens when Jamie himself falls for Anne and when Danny tries to secure a scholarship for Anne's prize pupil, Nick's granddaughter Rae (Marcy McGuire). Since MGM was giving Peter Lawford the big build-up, it is Jamie who ultimately wins Anne's heart, but Danny finds consolation with an old &quot;goil friend&quot; (Gloria Grahame). Musical highlights include Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante's imitations of one another in &quot;The Song's Gotta Come From the Heart&quot; and Sinatra's rendition of the standard-to-be &quot;Time After Time&quot;. \n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:42:55\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1712 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3eba4be8735cfdd29084186c0004e8cfa343cd","amp;dn":"It+Happened+in+Brooklyn+%281947%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3eba4be8735cfdd29084186c0004e8cfa343cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,62,186,75,232,115,92,253,210,144,132,24,108,0,4,232,207,163,67,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
