You don't need to take the ABR files from the folders.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cd314ff9735f6b901c8e4d5d866bf36ca77cb6","amp;dn":"Photoshop+Brushes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cd314ff9735f6b901c8e4d5d866bf36ca77cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,205,49,79,249,115,95,107,144,28,142,77,93,134,107,243,108,167,124,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
