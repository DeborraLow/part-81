Working with the FBI and NYPD, the agents orchestrate the arrest of Hadji Gumus, a well-respected Muslim scholar and family man who years before fled to the United States after being released from a Turkish prison, where he served time for murder. This tale love, friendship, peace and prejudices, takes us on a journey seeking to answer the question of whether innocence or guilt even matters to one who lusts for vengeance.\n\nCodec: XviD\nCodec: AC-3\nBitrate: 1679kbps\nBitrate: 448 kbps\nRes/FPS: 720x304 / 23.976\nChannels: 5.1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba40902ce4154d0c74d0027ae148e429563087d4","amp;dn":"Five+Minarets+in+New+York+2010+BRRip+XviD+AC3-SANTi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba40902ce4154d0c74d0027ae148e429563087d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,64,144,44,228,21,77,12,116,208,2,122,225,72,228,41,86,48,135,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
