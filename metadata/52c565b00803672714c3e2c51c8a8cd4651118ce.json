Ten years later, the story shifts to Igarashi Ganta, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life. This all changes when a strange man covered in blood and crimson armour floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class but instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.\n\nIt's a pretty fun show, enjoy and seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52c565b00803672714c3e2c51c8a8cd4651118ce","amp;dn":"Deadman+Wonderland+1-9+720P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52c565b00803672714c3e2c51c8a8cd4651118ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,197,101,176,8,3,103,39,20,195,226,197,28,138,140,212,101,17,24,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
