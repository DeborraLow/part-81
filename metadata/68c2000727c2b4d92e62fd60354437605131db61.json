While the Finns may have pioneered cello metal,\ntheir clumsy crossover attempts by way of including popular vocalists make one\nyearn for ars gratia artis. Judgement Day is that art, even if they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t spell\ntheir name the way James Cameron, Christian theologists, or the WWE would.\n\nAccording to the extensive liner notes, there were initial conflicting visions\nin every aspect of the album, from the songwriting to the cover painting. In\nboth cases, three minds were at work, collaborating as a trio for the first\ntime. Musically, it blossomed from an in-studio mixture of improvisations,\namidst compositions loosely hammered out in their practice space. As time\nprogressed, they relied more on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspontaneous inspirationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œabandoned\ntraditional song structures and rulesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The three painters were charged by the\nband to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcreate a piece of art with no predetermined visionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and were\nencouraged to continuously layer each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s workÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to not perseverate over any\nparticular area.\n\nThe end result in both cases is beautiful, terrifying, humorous, and above all\nelse, balanced. Siblings Anton and Lewis Patzner got their start on the streets\nof Berkeley, California some eight years ago, and wrote much of the music for\ntheir first release, Dark Opus, to be played as such. Now with metal drummer Jon\nBush in the mix, they add a deeper metallic layer to LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ conservatory-trained\ncello and AntonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bright Eyes-tempered violin. The music they craft is bold as\nit is delicate, demonstrating true innovation with genuine promise for the\nfuture.\n\nDifferent folks will have their own song preferences, but the album is strong. I\nonly suggest avoiding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œImprovisationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because, although the end product of their\nwork is excellent, listening to the process felt a bit less compelling. Be sure\nto check out the hilarious video for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCobra StrikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to see how the world might\nlook if video game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“heroesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ played violins instead of guitars. And according to\nthe date on the pseudo-authentic home video in the opening scene, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from the\nfuture. Now thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s progressive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c2000727c2b4d92e62fd60354437605131db61","amp;dn":"Judgement+Day-Peacocks-Pink+Monsters-2010-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c2000727c2b4d92e62fd60354437605131db61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,194,0,7,39,194,180,217,46,98,253,96,53,68,55,96,81,49,219,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
