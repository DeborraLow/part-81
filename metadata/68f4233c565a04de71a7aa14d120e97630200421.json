Within the plot of the album I'm Free tells of Tommy's vision to spiritually enlighten others due to his sudden and immense popularity. The Pinball Wizard  (earlier on the album) appears at the end of the song during the &quot;How can we follow?&quot; part. This song was used in the 1969-1970 concert classic set list. It is often switched with Sensation  on setlists, including in the movie and in the Broadway musical as Tommy rejoices at regaining his sight after the shock provided by his mother..\n\nIn 1975, the song was reintegrated into The Who's setlist. The version played at these shows featured more raucous vocals and a reworked guitar riff.\n\nIt was later released as a single, reaching number 37 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn 1997, the Christian rock band Geoff Moore and the Distance covered this song, on the album Threads. In 2004/2006 an extraordinarily close cover version was recorded by Neal Morse with the participation of Randy George and Mike Portnoy, released 2006 on the album Cover to Cover.\n\nThe song has been used in a Nissan commercial.\n\nTommy is the fourth album by the English rock band The Who, released by Track and Polydor in the United Kingdom and Decca and MCA in the United States. A double album telling a loose story about a &quot;deaf, dumb, and blind boy&quot; who becomes the leader of a messianic movement, Tommy was the first musical work to be billed overtly as a rock opera. Released in 1969, the album was mostly composed by guitarist Pete Townshend. In 1998 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f4233c565a04de71a7aa14d120e97630200421","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+I%5C%27m+Free+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f4233c565a04de71a7aa14d120e97630200421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,244,35,60,86,90,4,222,113,167,170,20,209,32,233,118,48,32,4,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
