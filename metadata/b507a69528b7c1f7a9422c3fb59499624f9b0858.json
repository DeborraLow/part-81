Alexander Nesterov is a meteorologist sent to uncover the mystery of the abandoned ice-breaker ship, North Wind. This steel beast once fought for its country, but during a dangerous mission it drifted into an ice trap that slowly froze to death every living thing on board. A routine investigation quickly turns into a battle for survival against both the freezing elements and the terrifying evil that inhabits the lost ship. Cryostasis takes players on a terrifying trip into the unknown as they explore the dark, frozen, claustrophobic corridors and unlock the shocking secrets of the North Wind. \n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;cryostasis.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b507a69528b7c1f7a9422c3fb59499624f9b0858","amp;dn":"Cryostasis.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b507a69528b7c1f7a9422c3fb59499624f9b0858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,7,166,149,40,183,193,247,169,66,44,63,181,148,153,98,79,155,8,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
