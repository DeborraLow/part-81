My one rule was not to sound like anyone else.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Judging by his bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album, lead singer Jonathan Higgs rarely had to send himself to the naughty step.\nFor while you might detect an occasional Yeasayer bass noodle or lei-wearing Vampire Weekend riff, this Manchester quartet flee from any identikit indie clique, throwing ever-changing, protean sonic shapes. They career between time signatures, changing keys and genres ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often within bars, let alone songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as they playfully elude categorisation.\n\nTelling of teenage terrorists, war, homicidal lovers and the human condition, they leap and crackle, JonathanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice a frenetic falsetto bounding like a Labrador on speed, to twisted brass fanfares or military stomps that challenge you to dance then trip you up. They grow wistful and sing in sync to a line of Baroque harpsichord (Two for Nero), or, on SchoolinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, drag you through as much terrain (pop, electro, jazz, funk, progÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and, er, whistling) as the most self-indulgent of Yes epics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but without the soporific effect.\n\nEven on the relatively simple QWERTY Finger, which has an innocuous handclap-and-drums opening, they give us a rushing euphonic mash-up of scaling synths and chasing vocals, before turning and returning, pausing midway for an anthemic break, complete with yelping. Yet this track not only sounds coherent, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s glorious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ despite the fact that here, as on much of Man Alive, the boys seem to be stuck in the surreal environs of semi-consciousness, where Lewis Carroll is king. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a place where lyrics such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo how will they remember us whole when we turn into salt / And it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mine, the fault, mine the dream, and the vein, home of whale-flesh, make soap out of it!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ apparently make sense.\n\nWhether theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re talking a load of gibber, spewing poetic profundities or playing auditory jokes (the criminally catchy chorus of Suffragette Suffragette demands a double take) it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really matter; it merely adds to their quirky brilliance. And it is brilliance. EE are wilfully eccentric, and endlessly entertaining, but they know more than most how to craft a song, how to make an album. They know how to give it depth, light and dark, and they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ crucially ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ know when to stop. Give it a month or two, and the EE wannabes will start to queue up. Luckily for this band, soundalikes are not an option.\n\n--Alix Buscovic\nFind more music at the BBC This link will take you off Amazon in a new window\n\nQ Magazine\nSlick art-pop shapes...
