Beethoven's Third concerto is more turbulent than those that precede it, and it shows a more experimental side of Beethoven's musical language.\n\nThe concert opens with music by John Foulds who had a varied life as a musician - as a cellist with the Halle, as a conductor, a cinema pianist, and a composer of both serious and light music. He had a fascination for Indian music and mysticism, and this had an impact on his work. In this symphonic poem he evokes a spring day.\n\nIn the final work Strauss places himself at the forefront of his epic tone poem, casting himself as the central heroic figure and portraying his own life as a struggle against adversity.\n\nPart 1:\n   Foulds: April - England, Op.48 No.1\n   Beethoven: Piano Concerto No.3 in C minor\n\nPart 2:\n   R.
