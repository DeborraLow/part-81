He picked up his first guitar at age nine and formed a rock 'n' roll band in high school. In the late seventies he converted to Christianity and his songwriting began to reflect his newfound faith.[1]\n\nHis career was launched with the release of his 1979 folk-style debut recording First Things First. Three years later came Matters of the Heart, a recording Contemporary Christian Music Magazine voted 1982's &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, ranking it among the top 20 contemporary Christian albums of all time. Soon after the release of his next recording, Non-Fiction, he served as opening act on Amy Grant's Unguarded tour. Lord of the Past: A Compilation followed, which peaked at 30th position on Billboard magazine's Top Contemporary Christian chart in 1990.[2] The album's title song reached number one on the Christian radio charts in early 1990. This was followed by Bennett's second number one song: &quot;Yours Alone&quot;.\n\nLater in 1990 Bob joined Michael Card on his The Way of Wisdom tour, performing in front of sold-out audiences across the country. Bob credits his tour with Michael Card as being the only reason he had a career in 1990 and 1991.[3] Songs from Bright Avenue was released in 1991, a collection of songs he wrote while struggling with the dissolution of his marriage. Bob's most recent CD is Christmastide, released in 2009.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c54450f6311d3898637813e7d61348b8f62602","amp;dn":"Bennett%2C+Bob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c54450f6311d3898637813e7d61348b8f62602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,197,68,80,246,49,29,56,152,99,120,19,231,214,19,72,184,246,38,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
