Killed the tinny and murdered the echo. Sorry this should have been how it was the first time, can the p2p scene forgive me? Yes it's another repack, but until we perfect the encoding settings theirs gonna be 1 or 2 extra...but it's no odds either way, and we want to give you the best possible release from what the sources permit. If you were satisfied the first time around, don't worry about it. Here's a great release of A-Team until dvdrip or something better comes along. This is the  best audio out I can guarentee you that, so add it to your collection, or don't.. I will still keep releasing what everyone loves to have. I included two samples, sample from the first release, and sample from the REPACK. Compare before you download, Enjoy //iNK\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; iNK &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img5/4749/2d8p3ev.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img5/4749/2d8p3ev.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img812/6471/2z8by8p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img812/6471/2z8by8p.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img204/7421/2qk1j5i.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img204/7421/2qk1j5i.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img401/3786/302an2p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img401/3786/302an2p.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img231/457/2vjy7ep.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img231/457/2vjy7ep.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img706/1896/2vl4chg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img706/1896/2vl4chg.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img197/6503/szel3t.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img197/6503/szel3t.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce47c6b13d8e07b4fa12f3f1586b9579e3f3766","amp;dn":"The.A-Team.2010.R5.REPACK.XviD-PrisM-iNK%28READ+NOTES%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce47c6b13d8e07b4fa12f3f1586b9579e3f3766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,228,124,107,19,216,224,123,79,161,47,63,21,134,185,87,158,63,55,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
