ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album that tells a host of tales for the\nSouth Wales quintet, as bassist, Ben Griffiths, explains.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA lot of bands these days are always aiming to please other people,\nthe endgame is to be famous, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the goal, the barometer for\nsuccess. Then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also the other end of the scale, where being cool\nis the be all and end all. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re something to 100 pretentious people\nin every city in the country, 3 months later no one gives a fuck.\n\nOur whole reason for being in this band is different from that. Wanting\nto do something that could maybe turn the negatives from your life into\nsomething that may provide positive experience, some direction for\nyourself and maybe even for someone else.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“VicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is that story. Growing up in a shit place, seeing things that\nyou only ever thought happened on TV and having to deal with all these\ntroubles at an age where growing up is hard work by itself, whilst\nstruggling not to carry these experiences in a negative light\nthroughout your whole life. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also the story of the problems weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve\nfaced as a band, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard enough being in a band, it seems itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worse\nbeing a pop-punk band, it seems itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even worse being a pop punk band\nfrom the UK. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hoping that people will actually judge us on what\nwe do and say rather that where we come from.\n\nSince leaving school weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen family members die, family members\nimprisoned, friends and familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives ruined by drugs, depression and\na lack of direction or ambition. Where we come from thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what\nhappens. Some of us have suffered from depression, some of us have seen\npeople throw their lives away, this is just our way of getting away\nfrom that, in some ways itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the only way we have to tell our stories\nand exorcise the demons that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had to deal with.\n\nWe paid to do our own record, we paid to press it, we book our own\nshows, we sleep on floors, we struggle to afford food. Our gear is\nfucked, our van is falling apart, we have rent to pay, one of us has a\nkid, the rest of us canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get jobs. We do this because we love to do it\nand everything we do is honest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79611d07f16662368be838b6a411cbeb7dbb1e1b","amp;dn":"Save_Your_Breath-Vices-%28Advance%29-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79611d07f16662368be838b6a411cbeb7dbb1e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,97,29,7,241,102,98,54,139,232,56,182,164,17,203,235,125,187,30,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
