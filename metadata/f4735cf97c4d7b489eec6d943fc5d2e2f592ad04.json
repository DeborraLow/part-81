The 'Big Four' can go to Hell. \n\nSome thrash bands are fast. We all know those bands. Slayer became one of those bands with 'Reign in Blood.' Every thrash album has slow parts and fast parts, however. Dark Angel is no exception; the only difference is Dark Angel's slow parts are fast, and their fast parts are 'too fast, my ass.' It's no mindless music murder, though. The guitar is beautiful, and Gene Hoglan on the drums . . . well, there's a reason he's considered the best drummer in underground metal. Who else can tear up the drumset at the 286 bpm of 'Burning of Sodom' or play as brilliantly and fast as he does (and keep it up for over 8 minutes!)?\n\nThis album is no joke. It'll kill small animals and children on contact. Careful where you play it.\n\n--\n\nThis is the original release (no bonus live tracks), ripped in mp3 at v0 quality (variable bitrate, ~245kbps) with an EAC log of the original rip included.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Darkness Descends&quot;   5:49\n2. &quot;The Burning of Sodom&quot;   3:16\n3. &quot;Hunger of the Undead&quot;   4:16\n4. &quot;Merciless Death&quot;   \t4:04\n5. &quot;Death Is Certain (Life Is Not)&quot; 4:15\n6. &quot;Black Prophecies&quot;   8:29\n7. &quot;Perish in Flames&quot;   4:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4735cf97c4d7b489eec6d943fc5d2e2f592ad04","amp;dn":"Dark+Angel+-+Darkness+Descends+%28original+release%29+mp3+%5Bv0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4735cf97c4d7b489eec6d943fc5d2e2f592ad04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,115,92,249,124,77,123,72,158,236,109,148,63,197,210,226,245,146,173,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
