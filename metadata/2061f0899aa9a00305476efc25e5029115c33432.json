Vincent Hanna and his team of cops in the Robbery/Homicide police division. A botched job puts Hanna onto their trail while they regroup and try to put together one last big 'retirement' score. Neil and Vincent are similar in many ways, including their troubled personal lives. At a crucial moment in his life, Neil disobeys the dictum taught to him long ago by his criminal mentor--'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner'--as he falls in love. Thus the stage is set for the suspenseful ending.... \n\n\nSorry for the size of this one but it could not be avoided.. The size of this movie made it impossible to get a good quality video at 800mb....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2061f0899aa9a00305476efc25e5029115c33432","amp;dn":"Heat+1995+DVDRip+Xvid_RMR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2061f0899aa9a00305476efc25e5029115c33432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,97,240,137,154,169,160,3,5,71,110,252,37,229,2,145,21,195,52,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
