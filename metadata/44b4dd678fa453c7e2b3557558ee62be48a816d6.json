Four suspects are still alive in the case. We play excerpts of &quot;Neshoba&quot; and speak with its co-director, Micki Dickoff. We're also joined by the brothers of two of the victims, Ben Chaney and David Goodman. And we speak with award-winning Mississippi-based journalist Jerry Mitchell of the Clarion Ledger, who's spent the past 20 years investigating unresolved civil rights murder cases; as well as Bruce Watson, author of the new book &quot;Freedom Summer: The Savage Season That Made Mississippi Burn and Made America A Democracy.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b4dd678fa453c7e2b3557558ee62be48a816d6","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+13+aug+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b4dd678fa453c7e2b3557558ee62be48a816d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,180,221,103,143,164,83,199,226,179,85,117,88,238,98,190,72,168,22,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
