Reba McEntire did her version of the song for CMT unplugged.\n\nThe song was covered by American country singer Reba McEntire on CMT:Unplugged. The cover was accompanied by a music video premiered June 18, 2010, which involves McEntire performing the song live.\n\nReba Nell McEntire (born March 28, 1955) is an American country music artist. She began her career in the music industry singing with her siblings on local radio shows and rodeos. As a solo act, she was invited to perform at a rodeo in Oklahoma City, which caught the attention of country artist Red Steagall. He brought her to Nashville, Tennessee, where she eventually signed a contract with Mercury Records in 1975. She released her first solo album in 1977 and released five additional studio albums under the label until 1983.\n\nSigning with MCA Nashville Records, McEntire took creative control over her second MCA album, My Kind of Country (1984), which had a more traditional country sound and produced two number one singles: &quot;How Blue&quot; and &quot;Somebody Should Leave&quot;. The album brought her breakthrough success, bringing her a series of successful albums and number one singles in the 1980s and 1990s. McEntire has since released 25 studio albums, acquired 34 #1 singles, and 28 albums have been certified Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America. Her album For My Broken Heart broke ground for female artists in country music, as it was the first album recorded by a female in country music to be certified double-platinum (selling two million copies) by the RIAA.\n\nIn the early 1990s, McEntire branched into film starting with 1990's Tremors. She has since starred in the Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun and starred in her television sitcom, Reba (2001ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007) for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television SeriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Musical or Comedy. She has sometimes been referred to as &quot;The Queen of Country&quot;, having sold 41 million records in the United States and more than 56 million worldwide. In the United States, she ranks as the seventh best-selling female artist in all genres and is the second best-selling female country artist of all time.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b4f9a71b640d282700ada3e1ec4d80d528cf61","amp;dn":"Reba+-+If+I+Were+A+Boy+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b4f9a71b640d282700ada3e1ec4d80d528cf61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,180,249,167,27,100,13,40,39,0,173,163,225,236,77,128,213,40,207,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
