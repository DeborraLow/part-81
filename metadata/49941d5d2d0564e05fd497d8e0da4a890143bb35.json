When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul.\n\n\n\n[img]http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/4738/23097801.png[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/1038/80825299.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/504/12634874.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/8766/61277682.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/175/E4FA621861A51E09B44842B10595E2EB.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\nGreetz to Fabreezy ,Imagine ,Flawl3ss ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom ,Tank66 ,Xclusive66 ,Prism ,Noir ,BDK ,TA and all other uploaders who serve the community\n\nI was going to use the so called dvdscr yesterday as a source but as most know now it turns out it was done with a professional HD CAM (shame all cam copies aint that good) ..So in the end just went with IMAGINES r5 copy which was pretty good almost dvd quality.I cant say ive done loads ive just done a few things the way i would do it like make it a touch sharper and alter the colours,brightened it up a touch too....\n\nAnyway theres a million and one copies of this out now but its here if you want it .......\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49941d5d2d0564e05fd497d8e0da4a890143bb35","amp;dn":"The+Expendables+Encoded+R5+SAFCuk009%2BFabreezy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49941d5d2d0564e05fd497d8e0da4a890143bb35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,148,29,93,45,5,100,224,95,212,151,216,224,218,74,137,1,67,187,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
