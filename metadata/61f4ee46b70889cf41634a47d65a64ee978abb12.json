Written by E.R. Braithwaite; Full-cast dramatisation starring Harry Hepple, Luke Norris, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ellie Haddington and David Hargreaves; Dramatised by Roy Williams; Directed by Claire Grove.\n\n1960, London's East End: twins Jack and Dave Bennett are a happy-go-lucky, rootless pair. If they do occasionally rough-up a black guy it's just a game to them - until a victim in Whitechapel fights back and Dave pulls a knife.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f4ee46b70889cf41634a47d65a64ee978abb12","amp;dn":"E.R.+Braithwaite+-+Choice+of+Straws+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f4ee46b70889cf41634a47d65a64ee978abb12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,244,238,70,183,8,137,207,65,99,74,71,214,90,100,238,151,138,187,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
