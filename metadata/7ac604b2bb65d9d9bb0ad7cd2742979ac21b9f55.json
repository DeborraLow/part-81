Most of the game takes place within a living ship, a giant entity that can sense and react to Tommy's presence.\n\nPrey makes use of Joseph's Campbell's renowned story structure, &quot;The Hero's Journey,&quot; for guiding the main character arc. Campbell's extensive work on mythological story progression was made famous when George Lucas used it for Luke Skywalker's story arc in the original Star Wars.\n\nPrey tells the story of Tommy, a Cherokee garage mechanic stuck on a reservation going nowhere. His life changes when an otherworldly crisis forces him to awaken spiritual powers from his long-forgotten birthright. Abducted along with his people to a menacing mothership orbiting Earth, he sets out to save himself and his girlfriend and eventually his planet.\n\nPrey is serious, dark story, based on authentic Cherokee mythology. Themes of sacrifice, love and responsibility are explored and the story dives into emotional territory not yet explored by similar games. \n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;prey.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac604b2bb65d9d9bb0ad7cd2742979ac21b9f55","amp;dn":"Prey.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac604b2bb65d9d9bb0ad7cd2742979ac21b9f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,198,4,178,187,101,217,217,187,10,215,205,39,66,151,154,194,27,159,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
