This time, we venture way out to the city of Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nVancouver in the 60's was very active with many great yet unknown acts and Mock Duck was one of them. They played around Vancouver in several incarnations from 1966 until 1970, touting their acid/jazz/rock style of music in many local venues. &quot;Test Record&quot; was actually an acetate pressing made of tracks 1 through 5. To the best of everyone's knowledge, only 14 copies were ever pressed, making it perhaps one of the rarest records in Canadian music history. Tracks 6 and 7 were other recordings made on 19 &amp; 20 October 1968 and are heard here for the first time since the live performance itself.\nMock Duck didn't only just rock; they breathed, they enjoyed playing their music....they lived it!! To this end, we have included here the 19:48 long &quot;Jazz Mock&quot; recorded on a Sunday afternoon in June, 1968 with members of Mock Duck #3. Regardless of its membership, Mock Duck were a driving force behind Vancouver's emerging cultural revolution in the 1960's. They opened for groups such as Fleetwood Mac, B.B. King, Country Joe &amp; The Fish, and Steve Miller.\nTheir following was extensive and they packed the local venues like The Village Bistro, Retinal Circus, and Big Mothers. The played alongside other popular bands of the time including Spring, Papa Bears Medicine Show. The Seeds Of Time, and Hydroelectric Streetcar. Their performance at the Aldergrove Rock Festival was a very memorable one for all band members.\nToday, Joe Mock, Rick Enns, Ross Barrett, and Glen Hendrickson all are still very involved in the music scene and with the exception of Joe, who now lives in France, they all still live in and around the Vancouver area.\nI would like to personally thank Kurtis Vanel (aka Doug Gyseman) for use of the master tapes and for his vision in 1968 to record Mock Duck on his Reel To Reel Tape recorder; Rick Enns for being the easiest of the band members to track down and bring everyone together again and for the use of his photos, Joe Mock for use of his photos, memory, and other items; and Ross Barrett and Glen Hendrickson for their participation and assistance in this project.\nby Roger Maglio\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
