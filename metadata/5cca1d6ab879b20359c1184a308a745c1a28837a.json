At night along the highway they investigate a crashed car and they meet and discover an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) who is in desperate need of their help.Although shocked by the appearance of Paul, Graeme agrees to give Paul a ride, but Clive is not happy about the idea. Later, Lorenzo Zoil (Jason Bateman), a shady government agent, arrives at the site of the crashed car and informs his mysterious female superior over the radio that he's closing in on Paul, and she recommends using local law enforcement as back-up. Zoil then recruits two inept FBI agents, Haggard (Bill Hader) and O'Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio), to aid in his mission, without telling them the nature of their target.\n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease date: 14 February 2011 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nSimon Pegg\nNick Frost\nSeth Rogen\nKristen Wiig\nJason Bateman\nBlythe Danner\nSigourney Weaver\nJohn Carroll Lynch\nBill Hader\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Paul Extended 2011 1080p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:4479.45 MiB\nDuration:1h 49mn\nOverall bit rate:5 730 Kbps\nSubtitles:Arabic,Dutch,English,Vietnamese,Danish,Portugues\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-06-21 15:54:41\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1920x816\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/99739910787621120028.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/99739910787621120028.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68525605538197119770.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68525605538197119770.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/94213176547928530067.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/94213176547928530067.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/53317514609343791558.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/53317514609343791558.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23307910274207550064.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23307910274207550064.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cca1d6ab879b20359c1184a308a745c1a28837a","amp;dn":"Paul+Extended+2011+1080p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cca1d6ab879b20359c1184a308a745c1a28837a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,202,29,106,184,121,178,3,89,193,24,74,48,138,116,92,26,40,131,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
