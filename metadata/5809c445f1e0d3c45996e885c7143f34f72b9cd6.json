HD Web Stream capture (thx shaggy)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotez:\n\nHere is the latest full length Scooby Doo\n\noriginal animated movie nice and early before\n\nit comes out on DVD &amp; BD on September 6!\n\nFor some reason Warner posted this streaming\n\nvia youtube in some new division of youtube\n\noffering VOD. It had much more hefty protection\n\non the stream than the average youtube video.\n\nTherefore the only way to get this done was\n\nto screencap the film. The video quality\n\nis quite exceptional for a screen cap if i do\n\nsay so myself. Audio is not the best ever, but its\n\ndefinately not horrible. I simply reencoded the audio\n\n&amp; video to a more standard format, though please\n\nnote that without the hard work and effort of\n\nmy Scooby'riffic friend Shaggy this would never\n\neven be here at all until it hits stores in \n\nseptember most likely! Sample included so u know\n\nwhat the quality is like before grabbing the whole\n\nfilm. Enjoy scooby fans!\n\n\n\nP.S.\n\nIf anyone is somehow able to get their hands on the\n\nsource HD stream file that warnerVOD posted, please\n\nget ahold of me and let me know. It would be greatly\n\nappreciated!\n\n\n\nP.P.S.\n\nI know imdb lists this film as Attack Of the Phantosaur\n\nbut i think they are just not up to date, the dvd/BD\n\ncover announced clearly say legend, as does the title\n\ncard in the film, so naturally thats the title i used.\n\nJust wanted to point that out as the imdb link still lists\n\nit as Attack as opposed to Legend!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5809c445f1e0d3c45996e885c7143f34f72b9cd6","amp;dn":"Scooby.Doo.Legend.of.the.Phantosaur.2011.WS.WEBRIP.XviD-T00NG0D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5809c445f1e0d3c45996e885c7143f34f72b9cd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,9,196,69,241,224,211,196,89,150,232,133,199,20,63,52,247,43,156,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
