It consists of wartime footage, movie newsreels, and propaganda films made from World War I through the Vietnam Conflict. No subtitles are available. Furthermore, the majority of the DVDs were produced so that it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t possible to fully separate the films with normal ripping software. Therefore, many of the disks had to be ripped as one long AVI file; some containing multiple films. I have ripped every disk to the highest resolution possible, with an average bit pixel ratio of 1.50. I would have liked to have released it all as one huge torrent (I still might if the demand is high enough), but after all this work, I really do not want this to die an unseeded death, so I have decided to release it in 6 batches to keep the size down. The DVDs contained no special features of any kind. Several of these films were either nominated or even won Academy Awards back in the day, and are not commercially available in other venue I am aware of. For each torrent, I will include the screenshots and technical stats for one representative film.\n\nRambam 1776\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/National-Archives-Century-War-None/dp/B002MD3UL4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/National-Archives-Century-War-None/dp/B002MD3UL4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAiJHAAdj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAiJHAAdj&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDecember 7th (John Ford Long Version)\nVideo Codec..........: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nVideo Bitrate........: 1462kbps \nDuration.............: 1:55:31\nResolution...........: 600*454 \nFramerate............: 29.970 \nAudio Codec..........: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate........: 224 kbps CBR \nFilesize.............: 1,471,340,138\n\n\nDVD 01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nuremberg (1946) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Nuremberg trials told almost entirely without editorial comment.\n\nDVD 02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Let There Be Light (1946) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A lost masterpiece by John Huston, hailed as one of the greatest war films ever.\n\nDVD 03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ December 7th: Short Version (1943) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ John FordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Academy-Award winning film on the Dec 7th, 1941 attack.\n\nDecember 7th: Long Version (1943) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The rare extended version of the Oscar-winning film by legendary filmmaker John Ford.\n\nDVD 04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ General MacArthur (1963) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WWII action in the Pacific, the post-war era in Japan, and the early days in Korea.\n\nGeneral Eisenhower (1963) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ EisenhowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life before he was President.
