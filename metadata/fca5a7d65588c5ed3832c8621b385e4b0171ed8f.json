The aim of this project is to create a powerful, optimized, modular, reliable and stable GNU/Linux distribution.\nThe system uses a new tool called lpms, written in Python. It is similar to well-known package managers but has important differences. For instance, lpms compile nothing and does not copy and file on Hadron.\nPortability is major feature of Hadron. Basically Hadron is a live Linux distribution which is developed to run on USB sticks. Nevertheless, Hadron can also run on hard disk and cdrom as well.\nIn our approach, modules are a file system that mounts to root. Otherwise,modules are similiar to packages of other Linux distributions. But a module can include many packages. Modules are described by using XML and small Python scripts. lpms tool reads XML spec file and collects files from the host system. For more information about this process, click here.\nHadron has software repositories. New modules(new packages) can be installed from these repositories. To do this, you simply run the following command :\n# lpms -a module-name\nlpms resolves dependencies automatically and downloads the needed modules from servers. In addition, lpms can support more than one software repository.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hadrongnulinux.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hadrongnulinux.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 1e48c126f86de707aee8ce6a36da7aea3ab8ca36  hadron-alpha-desktop-x86.iso\nmd5sum : 6d0781fe00815ac923b1726ff7400743  hadron-alpha-desktop-x86.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca5a7d65588c5ed3832c8621b385e4b0171ed8f","amp;dn":"hadron-alpha-desktop-x86.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca5a7d65588c5ed3832c8621b385e4b0171ed8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,165,167,214,85,136,197,237,56,50,200,98,27,56,94,75,1,113,237,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
