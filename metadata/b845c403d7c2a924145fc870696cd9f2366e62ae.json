CLEO went on to help define women, \nAustralia and the relationship between the two. Research and \nmarketing analysis showed the project would be a failure and the \nmagazine was vehemently opposed by the powerful head of the \nPacker clan, the domineering Sir Frank Packer (known to his \nemployees as God), yet Ita and Kerry, knowing the consequences \nof failure would be dire, decided to back their gut instincts anyway.\n\nWith courage and a stubborn belief in each other the odd couple \nwent for it, and the result was a magazine that not only surfed the \nemerging 70s zeitgeist, but led the way in articulating for women a \nnew way of thinking about themselves and their place in cultural \nAustralia. Women readers found in CLEO a manifesto for a new \nconfidence and an argument against the entrenched patriarchy that \nhad for too long defined the relationship between the sexes. Filled \nwith intelligence, wit, and a go for it attitude, the fledgling CLEO \ntook off on its first issue, taking Kerry, Ita, and a hand-picked bunch \nof iconoclastic staffers along for the ride. CLEO was a womens \nmagazine with a libido and a curiosity about almost everything...\n\nProduced by John Edwards and Karen Radzyner, PAPER GIANTS: \nTHE BIRTH OF CLEO is a Southern Star Entertainment production in \nassociation with Screen NSW, Screen Australia and ABC TV. \nExecutive Producer - ABC TV Head of Fiction, Carole Sklan. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/papergiants&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/papergiants&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
