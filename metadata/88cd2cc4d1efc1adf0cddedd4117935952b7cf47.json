The film was directed by Peter Cattaneo.\nLove Up tells the story of a girl who, while working in a London cafe, meets a &quot;raver&quot; who introduces her to the drug Ecstasy and the whole British drugs scene. The girl falls in love with the raver, played splendidly by Ian Hart, but - when fired from her cafe job - she becomes involved with the seedier world of dealing.
