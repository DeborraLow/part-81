Mr. Gul recently characterized the &quot;leaked&quot; Wikileaks documents implicating him in a string of attacks against US and NATO forces in Afghanistan as &quot;malicious, fictitious, and preposterous.&quot; \n[2nd half of hour 1, through 11:30 in the 2nd half of hour 2]\n\n\n\nAlex also welcomes back to the show film-maker, broadcaster and former broker and options trader, Max Keiser.
