This was the first set which contained the few short (but very important) unreleased cues, plus the missing half of &quot;Well Of Souls&quot; (previously on the limited OOP LP only). It is in full wav format.\n\nThis was kindly requested by a fellow Demonoid member. As soon as this mystery user completes the download, I'm leaving the seeding up to you maggots. I'm kidding, I love everybody in the whole world.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e90d3443a3e84f579e392299ca2b20cedefd46","amp;dn":"Raiders+of+the+Lost+Ark+Soundtrack+-+John+Williams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e90d3443a3e84f579e392299ca2b20cedefd46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,233,13,52,67,163,232,79,87,158,57,34,153,202,43,32,206,222,253,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
