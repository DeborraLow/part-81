But as they start to settle in something odd and strange begins to occur to their son. Could something supernatural be at work, and did the previous family just leave...or are they still here? Trapped in the only place they've ever known? And what did cause their deaths? Most of all...is this 'killer' still very much alive?[/b][/quote]\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2376a1e96836e1d06e843ecabc0f9196fe35afdb","amp;dn":"THE+MESSENGERS%282007%29450MB.DVDRIP.H264.AAC-PJRV+%26+PRG+RELEASE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2376a1e96836e1d06e843ecabc0f9196fe35afdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,118,161,233,104,54,225,208,110,132,62,202,188,15,145,150,254,53,175,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
