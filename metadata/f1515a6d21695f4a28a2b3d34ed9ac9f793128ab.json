When Trump announces bold plans for two\n      golf courses, private houses and a five-star hotel, not everyone\n      welcomes him with open arms. Protestors find an unlikely local\n      hero in farmer Michael Forbes. His 22-acre property is\n      surrounded on all sides by prime Trump real estate, yet the\n      stubborn local farmer is not selling. Featuring five years of\n      exclusive interviews with Trump and his family, the programme\n      tells the story of this controversial billion-pound development\n      from first announcement to the moment the diggers roll.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
