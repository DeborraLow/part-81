Tattoo Artist \n\nWhore is a 1991 film by controversial British director and screenwriter Ken Russell, starring actress Theresa Russell. While not a financial success, the film did attract some positive notices (and generated an unrelated sequel), but is largely overlooked today.\n\nAdapted by Mr. Russell and Deborah Dalton from the English play by David Hines called Bondage and chronicles one day in the life of Liz the whore. She speaks directly to the camera, docudrama style, telling us about her gang rape, beatings, daily humiliations and adventures with an assortment of tricks--some good, some turds. The film intercuts from the present to flashbacks that show how she got started as a whore, her failed marriage to Bill (Jason Saucier), her son taken away to protective custody because she's declared an unfit mother, and how a sadistic pimp named Blake (Benjamin Mouton) took control of her earnings and her life. Rasta (Antonio Fargas) plays the black skid-row philosopher who befriends Liz (her only friend in the film). \n\nLacking large studio support, the film was produced and distributed by Trimark Pictures. The film's small shooting budget is reflected in the choppy editing and production value. Presumably to save on crew expenses, Ken Russell is listed as camera operator in production credits (under the name Alf).\n\nAlthough told from the first-person perspective of a prostitute, the script plays more like a dark comedy. The film was in limited distribution in U.S. movie houses, mainly due to it having received the dreaded NC-17 rating by the MPAA, did not achieve critical acclaim, and quickly moved into pay-per-view and VHS release.\n\nAn unrelated direct-to-video sequel, Whore II, was released three years later in 1994, written and directed by Amos Kolleck.\n\nTheatre marquees for two other Ken Russell films, Crimes of Passion (1984) and The Lair of the White Worm (1988), are seen in the film. Director Ken Russell made the movie as a response to Pretty Woman (1990).\n\nThe original play on which the film was based was written by a London taxi driver, who based it on a conversation with a local prostitute he drove. \n\nRussell adapted the play to the screen as an answer to the film Pretty Woman released at around that same time. \n\nIn addition to its regular video release, Whore was also released on video with the title If You're Afraid to Say It... Just See It \n\nBanned in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n&quot;DOING THE BANG&quot;\nProduced &amp; Performed by Fascinating Force\nWritten by P. Nero, H. Nero, J. Spivey, T. Keith &amp; W.
