They continued topping the charts through the 80s and into the 90s with huge hits like These Dreams, Alone, What About Love, If Looks Could Kill, Never, and a string of other hits that showcased the sisters enormous talents. Along the way, Heart sold more than 30 million records, had 21 Top 40 hits, sold out arenas worldwide, and had a profound influence on rock music.\n\nRed Velvet Car -- the most personal and powerful work yet from Ann and Nancy Wilson, and their first album in 6 years -- takes generations of Heart fans on what truly feels like the musical ride of a lifetime. \n\nPowerfully produced by Ben Mink, Red Velvet Car is a thoroughly electrifying song cycle of largely acoustic-based sound and a stunning album with a true and renewed sense of purpose. Ann and Nancy committed themselves to writing and recording an album that was as authentic as possible, culling from their own personal experiences and some universal themes. The result on Red Velvet Car is an album of breathtaking intimacy and honesty.\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\n1. There You Go\t\n2. WTF\n3. Red Velvet Car\n4. Queen City\n5. Hey You\n6. Wheels\n7.
