Sound quality is rather poor. The audio is low and the vocals are pretty hard to make out at times. The video is okay for an audience recording from it's time. Especially with the audience member sitting so far in the back of the arena. Big plus is the fact that this is the complete show and that it's a great show. Very energetic.
