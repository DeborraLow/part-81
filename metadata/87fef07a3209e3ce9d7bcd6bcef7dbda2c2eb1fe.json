Coltrane was fresh off playing with Miles Davis in 1956 and was still a year away from heading his own sessions and three years away from recording Giant Steps, so it might be said that he was in transition, but then when was Coltrane not in transition? Dameron wisely gives him plenty of space to fill, and the rhythm section of John Simmons on bass and the great Philly Joe Jones on drums (not to mention DameronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own characteristically bass-heavy piano style) give Trane a solid bottom to work with, and if the spiritual and edgy emotion of his later playing isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite in place yet, you can feel it coming. But again, this is DameronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s date, with each of the six selections an original Dameron composition. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so much to marvel at here, including the Bahamian rhythms of the title track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMating Call,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the gorgeous build of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoultraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (often the title when this set is issued as a Coltrane date) and the undeniable grace and elegance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn a Misty NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (based in part on the melody line to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeptember in the RainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). The straight blues piece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRomasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is also a lot of fun, particularly for Coltrane. Mating Call, or whatever title it sports, whether under DameronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name or ColtraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, is a solid and frequently overlooked gem. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hesitate to pick it up. &quot;\n\nPersonnel :\nJohn Coltrane : tenor saxophone\nTadd Dameron : piano\nJohn Simmons : bass guitar\nPhilly Joe Jones : drums\n\nJohn Coltrane &amp; Tadd Dameron - Mating Call Tracks:\n01  Mating Call\n02  Gnid\n03  Soultrane   \n04  On a Misty Night\n05  Romas\n06  Super Jet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87fef07a3209e3ce9d7bcd6bcef7dbda2c2eb1fe","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+%26+Tadd+Dameron+-+Mating+Call+%281956%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87fef07a3209e3ce9d7bcd6bcef7dbda2c2eb1fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,254,240,122,50,9,227,206,157,123,205,107,206,247,219,218,44,46,177,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
