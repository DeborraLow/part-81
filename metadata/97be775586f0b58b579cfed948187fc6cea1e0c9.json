None of the other renditions compare quite \nas well, although the Germany production is also excellent in its own right. The \nHopkins version is poorly cast in its unsuitable selection of Claire Bloom for the\npart  of &quot;Nora&quot; as it defeats the purpose of the tale. The Jane Fonda version is \nof interest for mainly American audiences too certainly.\n\nWe have taken the Xvid movie file we first obtained and added the most lovely \n&quot;Irish green&quot; English subtitles using the &quot;Century Gothic font&quot;. The results are \nso nice in this respect that you'd appreciate the movie whether you are watching \nwith - or without the intent of using the &quot;always on&quot; subtitles as they are\nattractive enough to desire, even for those audiences that are in fact fluent in\nthe language of Norway too (in which this movie is produced). We converted to an\nSSA subtitles file the subtitles from the DVD subtitles folder. We the used\nAVI-recomp to produce this fine masterpiece. Someday we'll produce a file twice\nthe size for even the largest screens out there (if we can ever get a hold of the\noriginal DVD itself). Do enjoy this seed!\n\nMichael Rizzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97be775586f0b58b579cfed948187fc6cea1e0c9","amp;dn":"Et+Dukkehjem+-+English+subtitled+%28A+Dolls+House%29+Henrik+Ibsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97be775586f0b58b579cfed948187fc6cea1e0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,190,119,85,134,240,181,139,87,156,254,217,72,24,127,198,206,161,224,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
