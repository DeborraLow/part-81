Just as Carl BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢t was about to launch into the solo of 'Time For Heroes' the sound was turned down until the band were playing without people being able to hear them. Roadies then ran on to tell them they could not be heard, and the band left the stage.\n\nThey returned after a couple of minutes, with drummer Gary Powell coming on first and playing a similar drumbeat to Queen's 'We Will Rock You'. Shortly after BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢t, Pete Doherty and John Hassall followed, with the band then launching seamlessly into the solo of 'Time For Heroes' and completing their set.\n\nAs with their previous gigs this week, Doherty and BarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢t said little to the audience, although they did hug and kiss each other throughout. The band's set was also exactly the same as last night's at Leeds Festival.\n\nWith no more gigs scheduled, the reunited band did not give any clues about their future as they left the stage, although all four members did come together at the front and hug and bow in front of the audience.\n\nThe Libertines played:\n\n'Horrorshow'\n'The Delaney'\n'Vertigo'\n'Last Post On The Bugle'\n'Tell The King'\n'Boys In The Band'\n'Music When The Lights Go Out'\n'What Katie Did'\n'What Became Of The Likely Lads'\n'Can't Stand Me Now'\n'Death On The Stairs'\n'The Ha Ha Wall'\n'Don't Look Back Into The Sun'\n'Time For Heroes'\n'The Good Old Days'\n'Radio America'/'Up The Bracket'\n'What A Waster'\n'I Get Along'\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b65b98a7e16834fd2591fbaf3a715a398c184ddc","amp;dn":"The+Libertines-Reading+Festival-Saturday+28th+August+2010-MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b65b98a7e16834fd2591fbaf3a715a398c184ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,91,152,167,225,104,52,253,37,145,251,175,58,113,90,57,140,24,77,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
