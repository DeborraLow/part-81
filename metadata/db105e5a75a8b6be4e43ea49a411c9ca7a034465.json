With his songwriting, John Rzeznik confronts some of the issues that have become part of many people's everyday lives: \n\n'I wanted some of the material on this album to address the disillusionment of the difficult period we live in; I wanted to give a voice to the emotional uncertainty that accompanies hard times.'\n\n'So many people are struggling to keep it together through tough economic conditions and two wars that seem to have no end in sight. The ones who bear the brunt of these burdens are everyday people. That's who I want to speak to.'\n\nThe recording of the album took place in various studios in Los Angeles as well as the band's studio in Buffalo, and during the course of events the band worked with a wide range of engineers and producers including Tim Palmer, John Fields, and Butch Vig. The result showcases more of the well-crafted songs and timeless lyrics that have been such an integral part of the Goo Goo Dolls' continuing success.\n\nMost bands that were around in 1986 have come and gone. A lot of trends came and went. But through it all the Goo Goo Dolls have been able to survive and stay relevant. They have grown beyond their influences, and have spent their lives creating and performing great songs. And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about - songs. So as the trends come and go, or when the world gets caught up in the latest celebrity gossip, there will always be people hungry for songs that speak to them. And those are the people the Goo Goo Dolls are talking to. The Rest of Us.\nArtist: \nGoo Goo Dolls\nAlbum: \nSomething For The Rest Of Us\n\n[img]http://music.is-amazing.com/sites/music.is-amazing.com/files/imagecache/Covers/covers/goooo.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/ea49/ccfef5b7.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n1.
