Up near the ceilings of our consciousness, up where there are stars, and celestial objects and beings and feelings. The universal tapestry of lost maps and memories and ethereal stories set in patterns that lay across the edges of our minds. Falling through fields and ascending through mystery. The tadpole-tail ends of thoughts sinking into the plasma, drifting in and out of time, in and out of reality, in and out of space.\n\nreleased 11 June 2011\nAll music written and tracked by Starpilot over a 6 month period. All songs were made in Renoise.\n\nDownloadable in multiple formats here: http://starpilot.bandcamp.com/album/reveal\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40de6c534994e70418c0643745ef246d7eb3d84f","amp;dn":"Starpilot+-+Reveal+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40de6c534994e70418c0643745ef246d7eb3d84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,222,108,83,73,148,231,4,24,192,100,55,69,239,36,109,126,179,216,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
