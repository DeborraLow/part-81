Author David H. Eberly includes simulations to introduce the key problems involved and then gradually reveals the mathematical and physical concepts needed to solve them. He then describes all the algorithmic foundations and uses code examples and working source code to show how they are implemented, culminating in a large collection of physical simulations. The book tackles the complex, challenging issues that other books avoid, including Lagrangian dynamics, rigid body dynamics, impulse methods, resting contact, linear complementarity problems, deformable bodies, mass-spring systems, friction, numerical solution of differential equations, numerical stability and its relationship to physical stability, and Verlet integration methods. This book even describes when real physics isn't necessary - and hacked physics will do. - CD-ROM with extensive C++ source code that supports physical simulation; has many illustrative applications for Windows, Linux, and OS X; and is compatible with many game engines - including the Wild Magic engine, for which the complete source code is included. - Includes exercises for instructional use and review of essential mathematics. - Revised and updated to include a new chapter about fluid dynamics based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The CD-ROM contains implementations that run in real time using the graphics hardware. The chapter on physics engines was rewritten to include new sections on the physics tick, on multithreaded and multiprocessor collision culling, and on velocity-based dynamics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:803e87f82dc1c19ae62fcdf69982917427a3407f","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Game+Physics%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"803e87f82dc1c19ae62fcdf69982917427a3407f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,62,135,248,45,193,193,154,230,47,205,246,153,130,145,116,39,163,64,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
