Yesterday's Theoretical     |\n|   Girls and Swans leads to today's Hair Police, today's Wolf Eyes,           |\n|   tomorrow's who-knows (Thurston knows, and has his eye on them for a        |\n|   release on Ecstatic Peace). Sonic Youth seem intent on keeping in          |\n|   spiritual touch with that stream of youthful creative energy, as well as   |\n|   the world of cutting-edge art in general, even while being &quot;rock stars&quot;    |\n|   releasing albums for a major corporation. Even going back to the band's    |\n|   start they've had twin pop culture/underground interests, and an           |\n|   obsession with larger-than-life figures both countercultural and           |\n|   completely mainstream. Their song title &quot;Total Trash&quot; could easily         |\n|   denote both -- the outcasts and the pop stars (see Madonna, Britney        |\n|   Spears, etc.). They're walking a line of their own, not between any        |\n|   misperceived divide, but among several concurrent, but quite different,    |\n|   sides of the art/popular culture continuum.                                |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Think of the basic Sonic Youth sound, even underneath their most direct    |\n|   pop/rock singles (&quot;Dirty Boots&quot;, &quot;100%&quot;, much of their 2006 album Rather   |\n|   Ripped), and it's sheets of guitar, played in an evocative way, using      |\n|   noise as a graceful wall that's both a challenge and a force of beauty.    |\n|   The element that carries through all the songs, wild and quiet, &quot;pop&quot;      |\n|   and experimental, is not those moments when they're wailing on their       |\n|   instruments but when they take that same energy and smooth it into a       |\n|   super-charged dream-state. This is the invisible energy field tying        |\n|   together those disparate worlds (&quot;rock songs&quot; and Goodbye 20th Century,    |\n|   arena stages and art galleries, The Carpenters and Nautical Almanac),      |\n|   and coursing through their discography.                                    |\n|                                                                              |\n|   That background-generator sound is called to the front of the stage        |\n|   here, on The Destroyed Room.
