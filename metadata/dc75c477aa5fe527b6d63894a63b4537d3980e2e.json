PLEASE do not think of me badly, but I live in Thailand where there \n\nis the worst provision of the internet of anywhere I know. The quickest speeds are (supposed to be) 6 Mb! I am \n\nlucky to get 450 Kb - indeed - normally around 80 - 180 Kb! So, HD files, at more than 3 Gigs are just to big \n\nto download in any sort of realistic time!\n\nFor that reason, I am providing - with a time lag I'm afraid - normal low res files, which I, and perhaps \n\nothers, wil find more realistic for their needs.\n\nTurkey Grand Prix Qualifying in Standard Definition\n\nRace 4: Turkish Grand Prix, Istanbul Park Circuit\n\nRecording Source: BBC One HD\n\nJake Humphrey, Martin Brundle, David Coulthard &amp; Eddie Jordan present the F1 Qualifying coverage to the 4th \n\nRace meeting of the 2011 Formula One season, The Turkish Grand Prix, from the Instanbul Park Curcuit.\n\nPlease Note: The BBC Broadcast had audio problems at the beginning of the coverage (before the quali) for \n\naround 8.5 minutes or so. The sound, is initially dead and then very quiet. Near the end (after the quali) the \n\nsound gets a bit noisy and the level is reduced.\n\nCheers ...
