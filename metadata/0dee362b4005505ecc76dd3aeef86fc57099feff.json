O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and\nblessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and\nupon all of his companions.\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever tried in a moment of serenity to say sincerely, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I love you, my Lord?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Have you ever uttered it from the bottom of your heart? . Claims like these are very easy to make, but the real question is: do the words truly spring from the bottom of your heart? Do you love Allah The Almighty wholeheartedly? Do you love Him in such a way that your love preoccupies you from anything other than Him?\n\nAttachments of the Item : 1\nLink : http://www.islamhouse.com/p/353540\n\nFrom issues : http://www.islamweb.net - Islam Web Website","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dee362b4005505ecc76dd3aeef86fc57099feff","amp;dn":"My+Lord%2C+I+Love+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dee362b4005505ecc76dd3aeef86fc57099feff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,238,54,43,64,5,80,94,204,118,221,58,238,248,111,197,112,153,254,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
