ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a guy running for mayor of Providence, Rhode Island named Chris Young (pictured left, clinging to the Virgin Mary) who is providingwith the best video since Basil Marceaux came out of nowhere. During a live debate, Chris asked his girlfriend to marry him. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not clear if Chris sprang that one on his girlfriend, but sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s his campaign manager. So if she didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not doing her job. In any case, the marriage proposal has been the closest to normal Chris Young has been in this campaign. During a TV interview, Chris serenaded his interviewer with a song that sounded kind of like Gordon Lightfoot after a severe blow to the head. What I want to know, Chris, is where do you stand on the question of the gold-fringed flag?\n\nOn a more serious note, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a site with some great videos of the 1963 March on Washington. You might learn a little. And if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Glenn Beck, you might learn a lot. You might want to spend tomorrow watching these videos so you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to waste time with Glenn BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rally. And IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sending that advice out to Glenn Beck too.\n\nBruce Majors, the Tea Party blogger who warned people coming for Glenn BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rally that 80 percent of Washington DC is dangerous is speaking out. I assume heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doing it from a safe location. Majors claims his directions werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t racist. Really? The only way the could have been more racist is if they warned visitors about cannibals and headhunters. MajorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guide to DC is like a 2010 guide to the city for people who are living in 1955. I guess his warning that most waitresses and cab drivers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œare immigrants, frequently from east Africa or Arab countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was just an advisory for visitors who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t speak Somali or Swahili. \n\nFinally, Sarah PalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter Bristol Palin seems poised to appear on the next season of Dancing with the Stars. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know. Do we really want someone taking part in a dance contest who named their child ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrippÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? Not a good omen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5df94b51fab2d07bf6eb8fdedf7f21fec1e6a472","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+August+27+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5df94b51fab2d07bf6eb8fdedf7f21fec1e6a472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,249,75,81,250,178,208,123,246,235,143,222,223,127,33,254,193,230,164,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
