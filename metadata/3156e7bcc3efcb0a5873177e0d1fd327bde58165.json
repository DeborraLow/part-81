Alexander Korda's British super-production also put the British cinema on the map, which, until this film, received precious little respect in the international film community. The film, with tongue planted firmly in cheek, details the private life of the famous British monarch. His first wife, Catherine of Aragon, is barely mentioned -- explained away by a prologue which states that she was &quot;too respectable to be included.&quot; Henry then marries Anne Boleyn (Merle Oberon) but she is soon beheaded. His next wife, Jane Seymour (Wendy Barrie), dies during childbirth. His next wife is Anne of Cleves (Elsa Lanchester, in a prelude to her Bride of Frankenstein role), whom Henry reluctantly beds with his famous sigh, &quot;The things I've done for England.&quot; They divorce and Henry next marries Katherine Howard (Binnie Barnes), who also finds herself beheaded when she has an affair with Henry's friend, Thomas Culpepper (Robert Donat). Finally, Henry is brought down to size with his final wife, Catherine Parr (Everley Gregg).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024473/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024473/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-24473/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-24473/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:29:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 2055 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3156e7bcc3efcb0a5873177e0d1fd327bde58165","amp;dn":"The+Private+Life+Of+Henry+Viii+%28Alexader+Korda%2C+1933%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3156e7bcc3efcb0a5873177e0d1fd327bde58165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,86,231,188,195,239,203,10,88,115,23,126,13,31,211,39,189,229,129,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
