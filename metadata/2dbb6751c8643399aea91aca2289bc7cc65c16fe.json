Educational : MP3/128Kbps : English\n\n\nFor those of you who have read Charles Nicholl's excellent and disturbing investigation into the murder of Christopher Marlowe (The Reckoning) this play may be of interest.\n\nAs everyone knows Marlowe, the infamous 16th century play writer, government spy, homosexual and atheist, was killed in a 'tavern brawl'. This is the myth which started soon after his death by those who wished to paint him in an unfavourable light and this myth persisted through the centuries until the long lost inquest documents were unearthed in the early 20th century.\n\nThe truth is far more disturbing. In May 1593, the playwright Christopher Marlowe was killed in a government safe house in the company of two notorious government agents, Nicholas Skeeres and Robert Poley. Apparently, it was because of an argument over a bill (the reckoning) however the truth is far more complex. Michael Butt's innovative drama dons the cloak of documentary to re-examine the unsolved case.\n\nCast:\n\nNarrator . . . . . Paul Rhys\nThomas Walsingham . . . . . Blake Ritson\nThomas Kyd . . . . .
