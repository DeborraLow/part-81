After the first film, the series fell into the action thriller genres, and is generally considered to typify the &quot;buddy cop&quot; plot device.[/size]\n\n\nTitolo originale Lethal Weapon\n   Paese USA\n   Anno 1987\n   Durata 110 min (Director's Cut: 117 min)\n   Rapporto 1.85:1\n   Genere poliziesco, azione\n   Regia Richard Donner\n   Sceneggiatura Shane Black\n   Produttore Joel Silver, Richard Donner\n   Fotografia Stephen Goldblatt\n   Montaggio Stuart Baird\n   Musiche Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton\n   Scenografia J.

He receives a message from Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War friend who Murtaugh realizes he has not seen in over 12 years. Before he can meet him, he is called to investigate a suicide, and is horrified to find the victim is Hunsaker's daughter Amanda. Elsewhere, younger L.A.P.D. Detective Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), who is suicidal following the recent death of his wife in a traffic accident, nearly kills a disarmed suspect after flying into a psychotic rage during a drug bust. Wary of his behavior, Riggs' superiors transfer him to Murtaugh's unit, making them very reluctant partners.\n\nDuring Amanda's autopsy, drugs laced with drain cleaner are found in her system. Although she jumped to her death, she would have died within minutes anyway, making her death a homicide. After informing her distraught father, who says he was trying to contact Murtaugh to get Amanda out of the underworld of drugs and hardcore pornography, Riggs and Murtaugh go to question a pimp known to have connections to Amanda. Finding a drug lab on the premises, they engage in a brief gunfight with the pimp killing him, and Riggs saves Murtaugh's life. Having found the drugs and with the pimp dead, Murtaugh assumes the case is closed, but Riggs finds it suspicious that the only witness to Amanda's suicide was a prostitute named Dixie, who was working away from her usual location. They somehow deduce Dixie was the one who poisoned Amanda, then posed as a witness to cover her crime.\n\nThe next morning, Riggs and Murtaugh go to Dixie's home to question her, but her house explodes just as they arrive. Investigating the site, Riggs, who during the Vietnam War served in US Army Special Forces, finds part of the bomb, a mercury switch, that he knows only a professional would use. A neighborhood child remembers seeing a man at Dixie's earlier who had a special forces tattoo similar to Riggs's own. Seeing a connection, they decide that Michael Hunsaker knows more than he has admitted and Murtaugh confronts him at Amanda's visitation......\n\n\nDisc Title:     Arma Letale\nDisc Size:      33 199
