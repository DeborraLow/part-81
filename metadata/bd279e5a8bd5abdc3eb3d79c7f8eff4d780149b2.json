It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series.\n\nIntended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever became infamous in the video game industry and its name became synonymous with vaporware due to its severely-protracted development schedule; the game had been in development since 1996. Upon its release in June 2011, Duke Nukem Forever received predominantly negative reviews from critics.\n\nThis download is the 2.4 GB repack courtesy of Black Box - some items that are not important to the game were removed, and the rest compressed (installer decompresses to full size). Originally uploaded on warezbb by :I am AWESOME:. Enjoy!\n\nNote: This was originally contained in an ISO image, but people kept flagging it as fake so I decided to just extract it this time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd279e5a8bd5abdc3eb3d79c7f8eff4d780149b2","amp;dn":"Duke+Nukem+Forever+BlackBox+Repack+%282.4+GB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd279e5a8bd5abdc3eb3d79c7f8eff4d780149b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,39,158,90,139,213,171,220,62,179,215,156,127,142,255,77,120,1,73,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
