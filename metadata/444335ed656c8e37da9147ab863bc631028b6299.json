Their lineup is ever-changing, with only the founding members (the husband-wife duo of Jason Korzen, formerly of Barcelona, and Amy Korzen) staying constant. Contributors include Christian Scanniello, Ivan Ramiscal, Kevin Alvir, Armin Pruessner, Derek Strausbaugh, and Reid Dossinger.\n\nThis is their second studio album, released in 2006 through Darla Records.\n\n\n1.\tBionic Hands\n2.\tGeorge Romero\n3.\tI Started a Blog Nobody Read\n4.\tOverclockers of the World Unite\n5.\tMe and the SYSOP\n6.\tModern Gameplay\t\n7.\tRequirements for DJs\n8.\tMystery Man\t\n9.\tI Love You, You Retard\t\n10.\tUnconditional Love Definition\t\n11.\tShirley Beans\t\n12.\tHuygens vs. The Werewolf\n13.\tGood Friend Sticks to You, A\t\n14.\tDropping the Mir on Japan\t\t\n15.\tMost Dangerous Thing in the World, The (Invisible Robot)\t\t\n16.\tThings Are Looking Up in Lebanon\n17.\tAmbient Industrial Dronescape\n\n\nAfter searching for quite some time, I was unable to find a torrent of any Sprites albums.
