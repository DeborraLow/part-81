It provides a screen-reader, full-screen magnification and support for Braille displays out of the box! It can be run from a Live CD without making any changes to your hard drive. If you like it you can install it to a USB pendrive or to your hard drive either alongside Windows using the Virtual Version, or as a complete replacement for windows.  To find out more about the various versions of Vinux, please click on the relevant links. \nWe also have a wiki for many helpful articles, a support group you can join, and a Vinux blog.
