Two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), discover the game in an abandoned home and suddenly are greeted by Alan (Robin Williams), an adult who has spent his life trapped inside the game since playing it at age 12. Alan's only hope for freedom involves finishing the game, but this proves rather dangerous, as Judy, Peter, and Alan find themselves running for their lives from huge rhinoceroses, evil monkeys, vicious lions, and other terrifying jungle beasts. Director Joe Johnston, whose special-effects background previously came to good use in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, used groundbreaking computer imagery to simulate the thrills. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 45 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aed76b94befe31d2908c1bb03640779585d110b","amp;dn":"Jumaniji%281995%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aed76b94befe31d2908c1bb03640779585d110b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,237,118,185,75,239,227,29,41,8,193,187,3,100,7,121,88,93,17,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
