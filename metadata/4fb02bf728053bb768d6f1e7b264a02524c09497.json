(^_^)\n\nThis comes on Comedy Central. \n\nShow Nfo - Produced by Gary Sanchez Productions, the production company led by Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, this multi-camera sitcom for COMEDY CENTRAL tells the story of a young man (played by Chris Gethard) who won't let anything get in the way of his big dreams, even if it means losing his job and having to move back in with his parents and sleep on their couch. With the help of his friends, an ex-convict, played by Horatio Sanz (&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) and a burned-out high-school teacher played by Chris Parnell (&quot;30 Rock&quot;), the trio plan a myriad of well-intentioned schemes to save their hometown, Big Lake. Invariably these plans don't come to fruition and the gang is forced to go back to the drawing board.\n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY!\n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
