That pleasantly stoned, slightly detached, wonder-of-it-all feeling is certainly present throughout the album. A mildly bemused attitude towards the world is at the center of the lyrical excursions, married to accessible, pure-pop moves.\n\nThe debatable alt-country flavor that some heard on SLUMP is essentially absent here, with the balance tipped more in favor of that classic straight-eighths indie guitar style married to some gorgeous atmospheric production touches and some first-class melodic songwriting. With the combination of heavenly harmonies, hooky melodies, and kooky electronic effects, one is tempted to imagine what might have happened if the Electric Light Orchestra started out in the mid-'90s in a basement with a four-track and went on from there.\n\nGrandaddy: Jason Lytle (vocals, guitar); Burtch, Dryden, Fairchild, Garcia.\n\nAudio Mixer: Michael Brauer.\n\nUnknown Contributor Roles: Garcia; Fairchild.\n\nSpin (08/03, p.116) - &quot;...A warm and deeply engaging snapshot of fractured relationships and existential dread....it's a moment of clarity along the lines of DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or OK COMPUTER, the sound of art-rock lifers finding beauty in the inscrutable...&quot; - Grade: A\nEntertainment Weekly (6/13/03, p.96) - &quot;...Reaffirms a gift for creating melancholy melodies that are surprisingly sturdy and self-assured...&quot; - Rating: A-\nUncut (01/04, pp.84-7) - Ranked #47 in Uncut's &quot;Albums Of The Year 2003&quot;\nUncut (6/03, p.114) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;...It's a compelling psychological study set to lovely tunes, a document of a man torn between torpor and achievement...&quot;\nCMJ (12/29/03, p.7) - Ranked #7 in CMJ's &quot;Top 10 of 2003&quot;\nCMJ (5/26/03, p.6) - &quot;...Characterized by dense fuzzy purring, song structures rife with intrinsic familiarity and reflective, reserved vocals...&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dbpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e628817cc6c8914d09903713912981e9455db09e","amp;dn":"Grandaddy...Sumday%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e628817cc6c8914d09903713912981e9455db09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,40,129,124,198,200,145,77,9,144,55,19,145,41,129,233,69,93,176,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
