As in the original,\n Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists\nin a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective\n (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all membersof the opposing team.\n\nGameplay\n\nCounter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and consequently retains its team-based\n objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. \nThe aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective. \nThere are many types of objectives that a map can have, but the ultimate goal of the game \nis to win more rounds than the opposing team, which is accomplished \nby fulfilling the map's winning conditions. Some winning conditions include \ndefusing a bomb, rescuing all the hostages, or killing all the members of the opposing team. \nWhen playing on a server without respawns, if players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, \nunlike in many other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay. \nMoving and shooting also differs noticeably from many other first-person shooters. \nShooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously \nshoot will generally produce severe push-back. This can be difficult for beginning players \nto compensate for because the player's crosshair does not correspond with where the bullets actually \nhit during continuous fire, so beginning players may aim too high during automatic fire. \nThe amount of damage done by a hit varies dramatically depending upon the body part the bullet hits, \nwith great emphasis on hitting the enemy's head, which is almost invariably lethal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:898b574efffb8a91898d1911debc90e90b8ed627","amp;dn":"Counter_Strike_Source_Last_Patch_4608_V_1.0.0.63","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"898b574efffb8a91898d1911debc90e90b8ed627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,139,87,78,255,251,138,145,137,141,25,17,222,188,144,233,11,142,214,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
