The opening track of the group's debut album, with its pipes, button accordion, and percussion, could pass for any Chieftains record, but then the electricity kicks in on &quot;Hall of Mirrors,&quot; and the rest is melodic rock, not so much folk-rock as folkish rock, recalling early Genesis. John Fean sounds like he's playing folk melodies even as he plays runs on his electric guitar on &quot;The Clergy's Lamentation,&quot; and the group follows this with an anthem-like piece of Gaelic rock (&quot;An Bratach Ban&quot;) with a dance-like instrumental break. &quot;Bon Istgh Ag Ol&quot; is probably the best track on the album, and &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Furniture&quot; remained in their stage act for years, the latter, with its superb middle section -- favorably recalling Steve Howe's playing with Yes on their early albums -- transformed into a 15-minute epic. And just when you think you've got them pegged as a progressive folk-rock outfit, they deliver the exquisitely languid, almost impressionistic &quot;The Shamrock Shore&quot; and the playful &quot;Dance for Yer Daddy,&quot; which sounds like the Chieftains with vocals until Fean's electric guitar kicks in. And Fean's playing on &quot;The Musical Priest,&quot; by itself, is worth the price of the album. \n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. &quot;Happy to Meet&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:48\n2. &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n3. &quot;The Clergy's Lamentation&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n4. &quot;An Bratach BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n5. &quot;The Shamrock Shore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n6. &quot;Flower Amang Them All&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n7. &quot;BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­m Istigh Ag ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“l&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n8. &quot;Furniture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n9. &quot;Ace and Deuce&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n10. &quot;Dance to Yer Daddy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n11. &quot;Scalloway Ripoff&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:54\n12. &quot;The Musical Priest&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n13. &quot;Sorry to Part&quot; (instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:32\n\n\n* Jim Lockhart - organ, concert flute, piano, celesta, Uilleann pipes, pipe organ, tin whistles, backing vocals\n* Johnny Fean - guitars, banjo, vocals\n* Charles O'Connor - vocals, fiddle, mandolin, concertina, Northumbrian smallpipe\n* Barry Devlin - bass guitar, vocals\n* Eamon Carr - drums, backing vocals\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.horslips.ie/happy3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.horslips.ie/happy3.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA great album with also great sonics.
