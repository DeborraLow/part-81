Do not sell this recording. Share freely, losslessly and gaplessly.\n\n\nOU comments: this was the early stages of the tour of their album &quot;the caution horses&quot;, including 7 songs from the not-yet released (studio) album. Their previous release is a live album (from Toronto, Ontario's Church of the Holy Trinity in Nov. 27, 1987 concert), recorded with one microphone and the band surrounding it. This concert includes 6 songs heard in that recording (released in 1988).\nOnly 2 songs here are heard in the band's 1986 debut album &quot;whites off earth now&quot; (shining moon and me and the devil) which is an all but 1 song covers album.\nmaybe the Junkies' biggest hit around here (until &quot;a common disaster&quot; in 1994) is heard here (Sweet Jane). apparently\nthere are at least 3 sources available for this concert, and they all sound like they could be good ones (according to etree, it's even available for free DL there)\nand the dime search engine put me through a search of nearly 400 torrents to tell me they have 4 Cowboy Junkies torrents on their tracker, and none of them is this concert, which I believe has been posted from a shopkin source FM recording,\nand more recently from another uploader.\nthis recording was first posted in 2009. it is my own FM master reel recorded from WBCN as it happened (not pre-recorded).\nthe band starts playing before they're introduced, and it cuts in slightly but the entire stage introduction is included. once the recording starts it doesn't end until the announcer says good night. No tape flip or interruption. all the encore\nannouncer gabble is in there (there's not alot).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://qualitybootz.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowboy-junkies-boston-1989-fm-flac.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://qualitybootz.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowboy-junkies-boston-1989-fm-flac.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetlist CD 1:\n\n01.
