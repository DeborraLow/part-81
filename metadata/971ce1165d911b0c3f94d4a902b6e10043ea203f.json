And Udaan is anything but that. It is, however, a intensely heartfelt movie with a strong emotional connect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and with so much realism, that I cant shake the feeling it is, to a large extent, autobiographical. Even though it is populated with largely unknown faces, set in a bleak industrial city, yet this movie will linger in your minds for a long time after you exit the hall.\n\nThe plot of the movie is essentially a two liner. A 17 year old is kicked out of boarding school for playing truant and is forced back to an apathetic father ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and to a 6 year old half brother he didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know existed. Stuck in a small town with no friends, forced to study engineering and work in his father\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s iron and steel works, Udaan is a story of Rohan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s struggle with his loneliness and desperation. It is not pure entertainment, but it has got a lot of soul\n\nThe overbearing character in the movie is Bhairav Singh, played by Ronit Roy. A despotic father (with some probable army background, though its never suggested) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who does not listen to any opinion that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t match his own and runs his life with army-like discipline. He even insists his sons call him Sir. He stands starkly in contrast with his younger brother, the affable Ram Kapoor. He is the only beacon of light in Rohan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s new world.\n\nAnd amongst them, sitting quietly in a corner is his younger brother Arjun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t speak much, yet wins your heart.\n\nEverything from the background music to the photography is perfect for the movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Amit Trivedi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s music melodious yet not distracting from the movie and the bleak shots of Jamshedpur accentuating the void that Rohan feels around him.\n\nUdaan is a coming-of-age movie that you will identify with because of its honesty and sincerity. Newcomer Rajat Barmecha delivers one of the most subtle, yet effective roles in sometime ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ putting up a stoic face against the circumstances, yet showing us the vulnerable teenager within. The movie takes a slow pace, which in my opinion is essential for the viewers to share Rohan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s desperation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but some of my friends thought otherwise. That is probably the only slight flaw in this fabulous movie. Highly recommended ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971ce1165d911b0c3f94d4a902b6e10043ea203f","amp;dn":"Udaan+2010+Pre-DVDrip+Xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971ce1165d911b0c3f94d4a902b6e10043ea203f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,28,225,22,93,145,27,12,63,148,212,169,2,182,225,0,67,234,32,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
