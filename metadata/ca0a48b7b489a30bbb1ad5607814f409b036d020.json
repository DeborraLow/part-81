Allen and Laurel Smith have teamed up with their daughter, Charlotte, to investigate the swarms of ravenous critters eating the town's flowers, and stop the pests before it's too late. Help the Smiths by deploying a wild arsenal of lawn ornaments, bug-fighting plants and other oddball inventions to stop the threat in the Smith's backyard and beyond.\n\nPlace your items around the garden, then watch them fight the enemy. With the money you earn for defeating the pests, you can add more defenses, or upgrade the ones you have to be bigger, better, stronger, and weirder. Research new, more effective ways to protect your flowerbeds. With each garden that you rid of enemies, you draw closer to unraveling the mystery of the hungry bugs.\n\nDo you have the nerves to withstand an onslaught of ferocious fruit flies, aggressive ants, and slimy slugs? Can you plant a spitting sunflower without losing an eye? Do you have the right screwdriver to attach a rocket launcher to a garden gnome? Then join the battle, and master Garden Defense!\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iwin.com/games/garden-defense&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iwin.com/games/garden-defense&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca0a48b7b489a30bbb1ad5607814f409b036d020","amp;dn":"GardenDefense10.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca0a48b7b489a30bbb1ad5607814f409b036d020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,10,72,183,180,137,163,11,187,26,213,96,120,20,244,9,176,54,208,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
