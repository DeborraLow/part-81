Hackers like movies. Hackers are people and could be your neighbors, your brother, your friends. Presenting a portrait of the hacking community, created by the community themselves, this film breaks down negative stereotypes by letting hackers show you that they are really no different from anyone else. Delving into areas such as the way hackers think, what is hacking, hackers in the media, and women in the security/hacking field, this film will have you questioning your ideas about what a 'hacker' really is.\n\nCats :\nScott Davidson\t\t\nFlea\t... \tHimself\nGrey Frequency\t... \tHerself\nJason Scott Sadofsky\t... \tHimself\nSiviak\t... \tHimself\n\nData Technical :\n!!!
