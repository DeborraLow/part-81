Some claim the mission vindicated controversial Bush policies on harsh interrogation techniques. We speak with Matthew Alexander, a former senior military interrogator in Iraq. &quot;I believe wholeheartedly [Bush-era] techniques slowed us down on the road toward Osama bin Laden and numerous other members of Al Qaeda,&quot; Alexander says. &quot;I am convinced we would have found him a lot earlier had we not resorted to torture and abuse.&quot;\n\n\n- 50th Anniversary of the First Freedom Ride: New Documentary Recounts Historic 1961 Effort to Challenge Segregated Bus System in the Deep South\n\nIt was 50 years ago today on May 4, 1961, when mixed groups of black and white students took two public buses from Washington, D.C., and intended to arrive in New Orleans two weeks later. They were risking their lives to challenge segregation, and called themselves the &quot;freedom riders.&quot; President Obama has issued a proclamation honoring May 2011 as the 50th Anniversary of the Freedom Rides, and called on Americans to celebrate their struggle for equal rights during the civil rights movement. At last year's Sundance Film Festival, we spoke to Stanley Nelson about his new documentary, which tells the story of what happened to these brave students and how they inspired hundreds of others to join the Freedom Rides and eventually succeed in desegregating public transportation. We also speak to two freedom riders featured in the film, Bernard Lafayette and Jim Zwerg. The &quot;Freedom Riders&quot; will air on PBS's American Experience on May 16.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:133124e405360fc7c53abeb97a9ad2af3b9a3aea","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+04+may+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"133124e405360fc7c53abeb97a9ad2af3b9a3aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,49,36,228,5,54,15,199,197,58,190,185,122,154,210,175,59,154,58,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
