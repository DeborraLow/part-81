Appropriately enough,\n The Chemical Brothers start things off with &quot;Block Rockin' Beats,&quot; a chaotic mix of various sampled sound effects over a no-holds-barred techno-stomp beat. \nThis is the stuff that crowds dance floors in those trendy downtown clubs, a la The Future Sound of London's &quot;We Have Explosive.&quot;\n Pump up a drum machine, add some hard-edged overdubs and strange sonic assaults, and you've got 'em rockin'! \nThe feel on this disc is one of cold, hard technological mayhem, some of it quite original, like Tranquility Bass' &quot;We All Want to Be Free,&quot; a kind of futuristic chant, \nan electric mantra whose effect is mesmerizing. The chart-topping Prodigy is here as well, and &quot;Voodoo People&quot; is a good example of their crushing yet danceable attack.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5329247a6f6a83f29a104ef5d383a2dff7c7656e","amp;dn":"MTV%5C%27s+Amp+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5329247a6f6a83f29a104ef5d383a2dff7c7656e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,41,36,122,111,106,131,242,154,16,78,245,211,131,162,223,247,199,101,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
