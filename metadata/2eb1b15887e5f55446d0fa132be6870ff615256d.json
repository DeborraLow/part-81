Rookies can use the new Gameflow System to let the game call their plays until they're ready to take over. Franchise Mode has been given a Wii-exclusive makeover. This year, you're not just building a team. You're shaping a town that thrives or suffers based on the fortunes of your franchise. And the football party isn't confined to Big Game Sunday with a four-player Party Mode. Designed for maximum two-on-two entertainment, you can open holes, flatten wideouts, and bulldoze a path to the end zone while your teammate executes the plays behind you.
