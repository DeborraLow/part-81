There were also many mixes I did not use cuz they just weren't that different from the originals. All I had to use was a Creative Wave Editor that I got on a PC back in 1998 and some old cakewalk software from 2002 or 2003. I mostly just used the wave editor though. The results are what I call Mustash Mixes...\n\n\nEach mix I assure was not the workings of listening to the left speaker and not the right etc...\n\nI really liked foxy vocals &amp; the manipulated Purple Haze Vocal effects too. The Manic Mix? I wish we had tapes like these, one could only dream... The wind cries Mary swapped a few of the items in each channel. Hey Joe Guitar enhancements were interesting also...\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2607937cc00f7ae665ce9f576ca602955d849afc","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Mustash+Mixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2607937cc00f7ae665ce9f576ca602955d849afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,7,147,124,192,15,122,230,101,206,159,87,108,166,2,149,93,132,154,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
