The band is composed of Matt Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar), Jason James (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Michael Thomas (drums). They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic heavy metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e33507b1ff993ecfb9f07158e44a31615d040c9","amp;dn":"Bullet+for+My+Valentine+Discography%2C+and+Music+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e33507b1ff993ecfb9f07158e44a31615d040c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,51,80,123,31,249,147,236,251,159,7,21,142,68,163,22,21,208,64,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
