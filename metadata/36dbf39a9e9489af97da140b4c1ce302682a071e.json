The album was produced by Beluga Heights founder J.R. Rotem, who has also produced hits for Rihanna, Leona Lewis, Britney Spears, Sean Kingston, Jason Derulo, Rick Ross, and many others. In a HitQuarters  interview with J.R. Rotem, recorded in February 2010 (and published in April), the producer said he was currently at work mixing Iyaz's debut album and that &quot;it's all going well&quot;. The Album was originally to be titled My Life as a request by Iyaz but was retiltled and postponed, in order not to compete with The Ready Set's debut album I'm Alive, I'm Dreaming also released by JR Rotem. \n\nThree singles have been released from the album. &quot;Replay&quot; was released as the lead single on January 6, 2010 while &quot;Solo&quot; was released as the second single on February 9, 2010. &quot;So Big&quot; was released as the third single on July 6, 2010. The album was released on June 7, 2010 in the United Kingdom and it will be released in September 21, 2010 in the United States.\n\nKeidran Jones, better known as his stage name, Iyaz, from the British Virgin Islands, is a singer signed with the record label Beluga Heights Records. His debut hit single &quot;Replay&quot; reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2009.\n\nIyaz was born into a musical family and grew up in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. Iyaz studied digital recording at New England Institute of Technology and recorded music. Island Girls found radio success in the Caribbean. Sean Kingston found Iyaz through his MySpace  page in 2008. When Iyaz first saw the messages from Kingston in his MySpace inbox, he didn't believe it was really Sean Kingston. But after receiving three more messages, Iyaz thought he'd better respond and later signed a recording contract with Time Is Money/Beluga Heights. Kingston introduced him to producer J. R. Rotem. He released &quot;Replay&quot; in 2009, which peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 in many other territories, including the United Kingdom. His second single &quot;Solo&quot; was released in February 2010, and has so far peaked at #32 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also took part in &quot;We Are The World 25 for Haiti&quot;. His debut album, Replay is due to be released late summer 2010 (U.S.), and he also has a collaboration with Charice in the single entitled Pyramid.\n\nHe featured in the Upcoming film '21 Coconuts' (UK 2010) US (2010)\n\nIn an interview with HitQuarters, producer and Beluga Heights head J.R. Rotem described Iyaz's creative perfectionism:\n\n    &quot;Whereas others might work on several songs in one day, he might sit there and work on one song for days. The end result that he gets is usually an absolute gem, so heartfelt and genuine.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dbf39a9e9489af97da140b4c1ce302682a071e","amp;dn":"Iyaz+-+So+Big+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dbf39a9e9489af97da140b4c1ce302682a071e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,219,243,154,158,148,137,175,151,218,20,11,76,28,227,2,104,42,7,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
