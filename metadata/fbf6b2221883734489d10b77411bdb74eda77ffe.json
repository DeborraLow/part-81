Big Mistake, A \n\nDogs in Heaven is Pete Anderson's second solo outing on his own Little Dog Records label. His debut effort in 1994, Working Class, played down his country music association and emphasized his Americana roots. Dogs in Heaven seemingly picks up where Working Class left off. This time without the steady hand of producer Dusty Wakeman, Anderson still pulls off some spectacular moments. Throughout, his guitar playing is perfection; he is vocally akin to Tom Waits, which lends itself well to songs such as the Duane Jarvis co-write &quot;110 in the Shade,&quot; which is an evocative blues number, as is &quot;Feels Like Mississippi,&quot; written by Anderson and Kostas. For good rockin', Anderson proves himself on &quot;Chalene&quot; and the infectious &quot;For You.&quot; His instrumental title track is also notable, as is his cover of the Motown hit, &quot;Ain't That Peculiar,&quot; a nod to his Detroit roots. With his usual band, Taras Prodaniuk, Skip Edwards, and James Christie in tow, this is another fine example of Anderson's eclectic musical style. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf6b2221883734489d10b77411bdb74eda77ffe","amp;dn":"Pete+Anderson...Dogs+in+Heaven%281997%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf6b2221883734489d10b77411bdb74eda77ffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,246,178,34,24,131,115,68,137,209,11,119,65,27,219,116,237,167,127,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
