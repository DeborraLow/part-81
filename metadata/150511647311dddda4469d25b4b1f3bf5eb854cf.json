This collection of testimonials from criminal offenders, family members, and experts on AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s criminal justice system puts a human face on the millions of Americans subjugated by the US GovernmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 40 year, one trillion dollar social catastrophe: The War on Drugs; a failed policy underscored by fear, politics, racial prejudice and intolerance in a public atmosphere of out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThe United States has only 5% of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population, yet a full 25% of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prisoners. At 2.5 million, the US has more prisoners than even China does with five times the population of the United States. 8 million Americans (1 in every 31) languish under some form of state monitoring known as correctional supervision. On top of that, the security and livelihood of over 13 million more has been forever altered by a felony conviction.\n\nThe American use of punishment is so pervasive, and so disproportionate, that even the conservative magazine The Economist declared in 2010, never in the civilized world have so many been locked up for so little.\n\nThe project will unfold over a two year period, beginning with the release of this feature-length documentary and then continuing on with the release of short films and complete interviews from each of the 100 participants in the project, meant to represent the 1 in 100 Americans that are currently sitting behind bars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150511647311dddda4469d25b4b1f3bf5eb854cf","amp;dn":"The+Exile+Nation+Project+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150511647311dddda4469d25b4b1f3bf5eb854cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,5,17,100,115,17,221,221,164,70,157,37,180,177,243,191,94,184,84,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
