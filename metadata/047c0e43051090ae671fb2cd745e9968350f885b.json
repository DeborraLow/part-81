Interestingly, she does not feel cheated when Ramesh Ramesh moves on to marry.\n\nDame Margaret Natalie Smith Cross, DBE (born 28 December 1934), better known as Maggie Smith, is an English film, stage, and television actress who made her stage debut in 1952 and is still performing after 58 years. She has won numerous awards for acting, including five BAFTA Awards, two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Emmy Award and a Tony Award.\n\nAlan Bennett (born 9 May 1934) is an English playwright. Many of Bennett's characters are unfortunate and downtrodden, or meek and overlooked. Life has brought them to an impasse, or else passed them by altogether. In many cases they have met with disappointment in the realm of sex and intimate relationships, largely through tentativeness and a failure to connect with others.\n\nBennett is both unsparing and compassionate in laying bare his characters' frailties. This can be seen in his television plays for LWT in the late 1970s and the BBC in the early 1980s, and in the 1987 Talking Heads series of monologues for television\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:047c0e43051090ae671fb2cd745e9968350f885b","amp;dn":"Bed+Among+the+Lentils+%28TV%29+%5B1988%5D+Maggie+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"047c0e43051090ae671fb2cd745e9968350f885b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,124,14,67,5,16,144,174,103,31,178,205,116,94,153,104,53,15,136,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
