I don't know what this service transfers from my \n\nmachine to other machines on the internet, especially the MS ones. So I play it \n\nsafe and disable such functions. If you like, you can even disable these functions \n\nmanually, by going through the System and checking or unchecking some checkboxes. \n\nThis will take you approximately half an hour. But why wast time when a little \n\nneat utility can do the same in 1 minute? This utility was successfully tested by \n\nlots of users, and was found to disable all the known 'Suspicious' Functions in \n\nWindowsXP. It's customiseable, but comes up with the Default settings, which are \n\nrecommended.\n\nIs usefull that!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55a188ddca5f46d8b2a687a5464618e16ccfbf4","amp;dn":"XP-AntiSpy+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55a188ddca5f46d8b2a687a5464618e16ccfbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,90,24,141,220,165,244,109,139,42,104,122,84,100,97,142,22,204,251,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
