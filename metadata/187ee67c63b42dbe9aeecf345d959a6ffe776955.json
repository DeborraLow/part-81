Patched files for several important text files are only provided in English language.\n \nBasically just make sure you have SKIDROW Update 7 already installed/cracked first. Then download this torrent and extract the entire thing into your Civ V folder. Enjoy and seed away. For some reason it says viking content is available for download even though this contains the viking content. Don't worry about it as the vikings are there; trust me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187ee67c63b42dbe9aeecf345d959a6ffe776955","amp;dn":"civ5_update-1.0.1.275.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187ee67c63b42dbe9aeecf345d959a6ffe776955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,126,230,124,99,180,45,190,154,238,207,52,93,149,154,111,254,119,105,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
