They summon monsters called \\\\\\&quot;Supporters\\\\\\&quot; and devastate human residences... but why?\n\nSurvivors gather people with the power to combat the witches and called them Witch Hunters! Tasha Godspell is one of the strongest nicknamed \\\\\\&quot;The Marksman\\\\\\&quot; along with his \\\\\\&quot;Jack-O-Lantern\\\\\\&quot; looking Supporter. He fights the witches but cannot really bring himself to hate them... \n\nA few years after witches declare war on humans. They destroyed about 2/3 of the world. The remaining people create an organization that can defy/defeat witches called Witch Hunters, or WH. The main character of the story is a boy named Tasha Godspell who can use mana and a supporter, just like witches, which is odd because mana can only be used by females with the effects of prolonged mana usage usually leads to insanity. Tasha is searching for his sister who has become a witch. He struggles with his feelings of not being weak and his inability to protect his village and his sister from witches and strives to grow stronger for his sister, his supporter Halloween, and his deceased teacher\\\\\\'s memory, The White Witch. Tasha does not kill witches unlike the other WH. It\\\\\\'s revealed to the reader that Tasha is the key to humanity\\\\\\'s total destruction or their salvation from witches. \n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb366dc2b2363efa987e83ab97bfc8b8b3b4601","amp;dn":"Witch+Hunter+Vol+1+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb366dc2b2363efa987e83ab97bfc8b8b3b4601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,179,102,220,43,35,99,239,169,135,232,58,185,123,252,139,139,59,70,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
