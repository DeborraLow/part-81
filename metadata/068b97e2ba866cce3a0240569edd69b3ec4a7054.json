In 1983 he founded the Center for Psychology and Social Change (now the John Mack Institute) and was at the forefront of original research at Harvard University\\'s Cambridge Hospital. \n\nIn the early 1990s, he turned the academic community worldwide upside down because he wanted to publish his research in which he said that people who claimed they had been abducted by space aliens may not all be crazy after all. \n\nAbduction, Alienation And Reason is the story of one man\\'s battle with his academic colleagues to keep an open mind and his struggle to understand those who claim to have been abducted. His plea was as much for them as for the future of psychiatry. \n\nOriginally broadcast on Wednesday night June 8, 2005 on BBC Radio 4 at 2100 BST. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:068b97e2ba866cce3a0240569edd69b3ec4a7054","amp;dn":"John+E.+Mack%2C+M.D.+Abduction%2C+Alienation+and+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"068b97e2ba866cce3a0240569edd69b3ec4a7054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,139,151,226,186,134,108,206,58,2,64,86,158,221,105,179,236,74,112,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
