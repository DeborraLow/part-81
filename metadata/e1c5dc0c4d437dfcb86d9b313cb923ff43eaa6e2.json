But now that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made it out of the bloody arena alive, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. Not KatnissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne CollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking The Hunger Games trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.\n\n*****************\n\nthe last book in the hunger games trilogy\n\navailable in docx (word 2010), pdf, and epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c5dc0c4d437dfcb86d9b313cb923ff43eaa6e2","amp;dn":"Mockingjay+-+part+3+of+te+hunger+games+trilogy+-+by+Suzanne+Coll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c5dc0c4d437dfcb86d9b313cb923ff43eaa6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,197,220,12,77,67,125,252,184,109,155,49,60,185,35,255,67,234,166,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
