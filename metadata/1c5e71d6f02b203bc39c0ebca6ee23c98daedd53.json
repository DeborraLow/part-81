He grew up in the underground computer subculture called the demoscene on the Amiga, C64, Gameboy and PC since the early 1990\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s. Soon he was developing a relationship especially with the Commodore 64 where his brain and the soundchips would form a buggy and dirty relationship.\n\nAlready in his early teens he would explore musical styles ranging from ambient through cheesy 1980\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s music through to gabber and noisy breaks.\n\nAfter his first first vinyl release in 2001 he gained a reputation outside the geek communities, and also started performing live.\n\nHe kept expanding the boundaries of chip music to work with several retarded musical styles, and added more vocals.\n\nHis music has also been heard under alot of other names, such as the lo-fi c64 guitar band SuperdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ner and the vocal micropop duo HT.\n\nJust as in the demoscene, he collaborates alot with visual artists, especially Entter and Jossystem to do live shows that at this point are far from silent nerdery and videogame nostalgia.\n\nGoto80 still tries to push the boundaries of the 8-bit sound and has by now developed an unmatched skill of abusing different music genres with his personal chip-music touch.\n\nIn 2007 he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s performed about 100 shows and made about 40 releases - most of them for free download.\n\n\nGoto80 5% of his music for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;unfree\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;... This releases also here, but I highly recommend to check out how it can be bought, and supply the author!\nAlso, there is a data tracks on the discs.
