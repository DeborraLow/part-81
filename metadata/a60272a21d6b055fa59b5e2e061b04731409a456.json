Evidence that Frank Zappa initially worked with these musicians for their tremendous instrumental prowess is obvious throughout this self-titled effort. The angular and Baroque progressions of \\&quot;Quaker\\'s Earthquake\\&quot; recall Zappa\\'s orchestrations circa the Uncle Meat (1969) project. \\&quot;Siesta\\&quot; allows Bunk Gardner to unveil his tremendous versatility on what is undoubtedly the most pleasant surprise for listeners expecting an album of nothing but avant-garde and R&amp;B material. The gentle tune recalls Erik Satie\\'s 3 GymnopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dies (1888), with multiple melodies that diverge and reunite in an effortless interaction. The more introspective performances sit remarkably well beside the hammer-down ethos of \\&quot;Low Ridin\\' Man\\&quot; and the equally gritty \\&quot;Bullwhip.\\&quot; As a rock &amp; roll band, Geronimo Black foreshadows the sonic attack and verve that informed many of Captain Beefheart\\'s Magic Bands. This is prominent throughout the cut \\&quot;Other Man,\\&quot; which boasts a rhythmically off-kilter introduction and gallop that is strikingly similar to \\&quot;Safe as Milk.\\&quot; The horn section takes the combo into the realm of jazz fusion. However, rather than leading the group, as per Chicago or the Loading Zone, they simply augment the arrangement ? la the Tower of Power horn section, which adds a bite of brass within the context of R&amp;B and soul. \\&quot;L.A. County Jail \\'59 C/S\\&quot; is an odd blues that invokes the spirit of the Electric Flag\\'s \\&quot;You Just Don\\'t Realize.\\&quot; The straight-ahead rocker \\&quot;Let Us Live\\&quot; is a protest boogie that rises to the occasion with some nifty little horn riffs punctuating the emphatic vocals. The band re-formed in the early \\'80s on its way to becoming the Grandmothers -- which also incorporated the talents of another ex-MOI, Don Preston. While the initial attraction of Geronimo Black might lie in its Zappa connection, this effort firmly stands on its own merits and equally unique consortium of versatile talents.\\&quot; \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60272a21d6b055fa59b5e2e061b04731409a456","amp;dn":"Geronimo+Black+-+Geronimo+Black+%281972%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60272a21d6b055fa59b5e2e061b04731409a456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,2,114,162,29,107,5,95,165,155,94,46,6,27,4,115,20,9,164,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
