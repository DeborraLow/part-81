North is today almost completely forgotten in Britain and remembered in Chile only to be vilified as the archetypal predatory capitalist. This book calls for a revaluation of North and examines several controversiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½principally the enduring allegations that North manipulated the War of the Pacific and the Chilean Civil War of 1891. The book describes North's business activities; his re-invention as country gentleman at Avery Hill mansion; and his generosity, including the gift of Kirkstall Abbey to the city of Leeds.\n\nReview\n&quot;Well-written . . . and contributes new information about NorthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and the relation of that life to the economic development of Chile.&quot;--Michael MonteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, Professor of History, University of California, San Diego\n \n&quot;A revealing, entertaining, and long-needed biography of one of the nineteenth-centuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most flamboyant and controversial international capitalists--'Colonel' John Thomas North. Edmundson adeptly exploits previously unknown archival materials, the contemporary press, and a vast academic literature on the nitrate industry and Chilean politics to bring the 'Colonel' back to life in all his complexity.&quot;--Brian Loveman, Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, San Diego State University and author of Chile: The Legacy of Hispanic Capitalism and No Higher Law: American Foreign Policy and the Western Hemisphere since 1776\n \n&quot;The author's research, conscientiously carried out in English archives, and the collaboration of experts in information and of libraries, not only proves the seriousness of EdmundsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work, but also the tireless idea of unraveling the life and actions of North in Chile and in other countries where he made investments.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“El regresso de John Thomas North,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Diario 21, Iquique, Chile.
