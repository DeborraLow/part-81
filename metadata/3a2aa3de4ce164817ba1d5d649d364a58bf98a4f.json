But when \nFrench intelligence agents shut their \noperation down, they must continue \nthe mission while avoiding an \ninternational incident.\n\nIf the CRF so-called 'rules' are \nabout quality, then why is the \nratefacor 20? With 18 being pretty \nmuch transparent to source, would it \nnot be the logical solution to use \n18? And medium preset? Seriously? \nSo the settings stay more or less\nthe same and still ignore half of \nthe detail and quality of the source \neven though we all got now fancy \nshmancy cpus that can handle real \nsettings and raise the bar on quality \nthat the previous section rules \nalready sat so low? O wait, I forgot, \nthe posers at IMMERSE just wanted crf \nso that they could finally use their \n'live-encoding' tool, and pre even \nworse quality trash 15 seconds after \na show ends on their poor quality \nHalf-HD bitrate sources. \n\n&quot;Fast as fast can be, you'll never\ncatch me&quot; - The Jackalope\n[10 bonus points for anyone who \nknows the origin of the Jackalope]\n\nIf anyone can explain why douches \nare so determined to pre subpar \nshit, please let us know.\n\nEnjoy ;)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n924e461726d984a678301222f2c1a81b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a2aa3de4ce164817ba1d5d649d364a58bf98a4f","amp;dn":"Chaos.S01E07.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a2aa3de4ce164817ba1d5d649d364a58bf98a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,42,163,222,76,225,100,129,123,161,213,214,73,211,100,165,139,249,138,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
