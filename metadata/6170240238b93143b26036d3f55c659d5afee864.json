The characters are well done, the animation works fine and is also well illuminated. The humans characters design are similar to others we had seen in other movies, but well animated. Lot of action, and nice scenes. In the original version (Spanish) the jokes were OK, not the usual easy humor for kids, so isn't boring for adults. And the most important thing is the Story. Remember you about the imprisioned animals (like in Madagascar) and presents you a wild cat, the Spanish Lynx: Pardel or Iberian Lynx, which is a endangered animal.\n\nFor all these reasons I will recommend to everyone this movie, not a must see but a nice animated Story to watch with the kids or with everyone who loves animals. \n\nNTSC\nDVD\nMenu\nExtras\n\n\nThanks For This Movie To:\n\nThemasteronetwo\n\nASPECTS:\n\n[X] NTSC [ ] PAL        [X] DVD5 [ ] DVD9\n[X] Widescreen 16x9     [ ] Anamorphic\n[ ] Letterbox           [ ] Fullscreen 4x3\n\nAUDiO:\n\n[X] English             [X] Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround [X] Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n[X] Spanish             [X] Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround [X] Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n[X] French              [X] Dolby Digital 2.0\n                        [ ] DTS 5.1\n\n                       \nViDEO:                  MENU:            DVD-EXTRAS:\n\n[X] Untouched           [X] Untouched    [X] Untouched\n[ ] Re-Encoded          [ ] Reauthored   [ ] Re-Encoded\n[X] CCE Passes                           [X] CCE Passes\n[ ] Partial Stripped                     [ ] Stripped Extra previews\n\n\nSUBTiTLES:\n\n[X] English      [ ] Spanish      [ ] French   \n[ ] Other        [ ] N/A   \n\nThis DVD contains a DIGITAL COPY of the Missing Lynx.\nYour digital copy is compatible with iTunes and windows media\nand can be easily transferred to your computer and some portable\nmedia players Such a ipod, psp, etc...\n\nTo do this, follow the instructions located in the menu of the movie, special features....
