The person who found this mysterious 16mm film in his basement in 1973, Rev. Ivan Stang, later ran The SubGenius Foundation, the Slack Prophecy religion devoted to Texas cult religion salesman J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs. There is some evidence that The Firesign Theater may also have been involved at some point.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070303/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070303/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRaw, black satire of didactic films and overly optimistic utopian progress films associated with vintage newsreels of the mid 20th century. Edited in with the super cheerful female 'official narration' are dramatic tableaux of intense emotional pain suffered by individuals who still maintain a semblance of humanity. This handful of individuals resist or never fully adjust to the artificial and soporific lifestyle instituted and promoted by the 'future' society's power bosses- the power mad and sadistic Bozos, characterized as sleazy clowns.\n\nDifficult to categorize...it's too real for science fiction, the humor is too black to call it a comedy.\n\nPerhaps it can be considered a social mockumentary...\n\nHighly recommended and thought provoking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a33fb607303102efb96077e3a981548048de34","amp;dn":"Lets_Visit_the_World_of_the_Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a33fb607303102efb96077e3a981548048de34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,163,63,182,7,48,49,2,239,185,96,119,227,169,129,84,128,72,222,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
