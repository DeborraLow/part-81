They include several Zombie Chicken Taco Team maps and some other ones as well. These are thoroughly enjoyable to play. \n\nInstalling Instructions\n\n1. Download using a bittorrent client (uTorrent, Bittorrent, Vuze .. etc. etc.)\n2. Unrar them to Computer/Program Files/Activision/Call of Duty - World at War/Mods \n\n(if the mods folder is not there then you will have to go to \n\nComputer/Users/(Your User)/AppData/Local/Activision/CodWaw/Mods\n\n(if you cannot find the AppData folder in Your User then you will need to go to Folder Options and select: view hidden files and folders)\n\n3. Open up Call of Duty: World at War. Go to the singleplayer/Co-Op menu, click on mods and then they should all be there :D Just select which one you want, and then you can either host a Co-Op or Join one as long as the person you want to play with has the same map mods as you.\n\nIf you want to play singleplayer on the maps, you will need to enable the console and type in: /map nazi_zombie_(then the name of the map)\n\nI DID NOT MAKE THESE MAPS, I AM JUST UPLOADING THE ONES I HAVE DOWNLOADED TO SAVE YOU THE TIME HUNTING AROUND FOR GOOD ONES. GOOD LUCK AND HOPE YOU ENJOY!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61cbf5aeea04d07f4a7c1a0b5ffe8c71c22b06f","amp;dn":"ZOMBIE+MAP+MODS+FOR+CALL+OF+DUTY+WORLD+AT+WAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61cbf5aeea04d07f4a7c1a0b5ffe8c71c22b06f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,28,191,90,238,160,77,7,244,167,193,160,181,255,232,199,28,34,176,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
