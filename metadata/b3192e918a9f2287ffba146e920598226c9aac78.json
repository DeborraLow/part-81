As always, this is a traditional 'Shooters recording' - no overdubs, no special effects. We try to capture our live sound as realistically as possible.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3192e918a9f2287ffba146e920598226c9aac78","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Ten+Cent+Shooters+-+Wild+About+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3192e918a9f2287ffba146e920598226c9aac78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,25,46,145,138,159,34,135,255,186,20,110,146,5,152,34,108,154,172,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
