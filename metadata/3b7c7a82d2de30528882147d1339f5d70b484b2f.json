Dragging something should now provide instant response\n    Changed select-behavior: CTRL toggles selection, CTRL+SHIFT adds to selection and SHIFT deselects (as before). The old behavior is available via &quot;App.GUI.ctrlSelection = false&quot;)\n    Better sketch recognitioning\n    Erase selected water by drawing a line over it\n    New icons for a few things\n    Clicking a selected object now does nothing. This means you can double-click one of several selected objects to get the context menu, improving usability on touch screens\n    Nicer tool-bar flip\n    Added ability to unlock Algodoo for one user only when not logged in as admin\n    Rescaling a box now leaves the text scale be unless the scale is axis-uniform (Scale-tool + SHIFT)\n    Added console search via / (example: type in &quot;/gravity&quot; and press enter)\n    Language support for Chinese, English, German, Japanese, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish\n    Hundreds of fixes and tweaks! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlgodoo a barrier-breaker, creating a new synergy between science and art.\n\nALGODOO is a unique 2D-simulation software from Algoryx Simulation AB. Algodoo is designed in a playful, cartoony manner, making it a perfect tool for creating interactive scenes and physical experiments. Algodoo encourages students and childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own creativity, ability and motivation to construct knowledge. Making it as entertaining as it is educational. Algodoo is also a perfect aid for children to learn and practice physics at home.\n\n    FUNCTIONALITY - Create and edit using simple drawing tools. Interact by click and drag, tilt and shake. Use color traces, graphs, forces, etc. for enhanced visualization. \n\n    PHYSICAL ELEMENTS - Build and explore with rigid bodies, fluids, chains, gears, gravity, friction, restitution, springs, hinges, motors, light rays, optics, lenses. \n\n    USER COMMUNITY - Algodoo has a large and active community, engaging educators, parents and kids. This website enables collaborative authoring of lessons and lecture material. Algodoo also comes with lesson plans for different key stages in education. \n\n    METHODS - Algodoo is based on the latest technologies, from Algoryx Simultion AB, for interactive multiphysics simulation, including variational mechanical integrators and high performance numerical methods. \n\n\nAlgodoo runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Algodoo is optimized for the IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® powered convertible Classmate PC and interactive whiteboard systems.
