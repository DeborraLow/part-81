Quality of the film is quite low, it's the only\ncopy I have been able to get my hands to. The release gives some insight into the Finnish neo-nazi scene, but it is also a very personal story\nof a real person all can relate to in some form. Features Finnish celebrities!\n\nThe purpose of this film is to inform and to entertain, nothing else.\n\n-link for the smaller .avi of the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb67ab328f83f1df88e821a6b265a5b2ff2353a2","amp;dn":"El%C3%A4m%C3%A4ni+SUPOn+varjossa+2+%281999%29+%5BDVDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb67ab328f83f1df88e821a6b265a5b2ff2353a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,103,171,50,143,131,241,223,136,232,33,166,178,101,165,178,255,35,83,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
