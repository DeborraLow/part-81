Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.\n\nWhen used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.\n\nWhats new in version 2.1\n\nYou can also memorize a window layout, which can then be quickly recalled via keyboard or mouse. See Custom Controls for more information on saving and restoring window layouts.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS X.6.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6b9471cb4cdc2141e1e6e373ec36335d945c2b","amp;dn":"Moom+2.0+%2B+SK+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6b9471cb4cdc2141e1e6e373ec36335d945c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,107,148,113,203,76,220,33,65,225,230,227,115,236,54,51,93,148,92,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
