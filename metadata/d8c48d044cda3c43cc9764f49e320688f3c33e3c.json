We're still not quite sure if there is any more to follow.[/b][/quote]\n\n\n\nCast:\nPatrick Barlow\nJohn Ramm\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/national_theatre_brent_icons/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/national_theatre_brent_icons/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe National Theatre Of Brent's Iconic Icons - S01 - E01 - Bob Dylan\nThe National Theatre Of Brent's Iconic Icons - S01 - E02 - Tracey Emin And How She Done The Bed\n\n\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c48d044cda3c43cc9764f49e320688f3c33e3c","amp;dn":"The+National+Theatre+Of+Brents+Iconic+Icons+-+%28+NTOB+%29+-+Audio+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c48d044cda3c43cc9764f49e320688f3c33e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,196,141,4,76,218,60,67,204,151,100,244,158,50,6,136,243,195,62,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
