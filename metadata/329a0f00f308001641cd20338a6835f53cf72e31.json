An issue that many people I know find controversial and helping TPB make a point in the world.\n\nHopefully to be a series as time goes on and people I meet and talk to give me some new insight as to what is going on. This is the way around 150 people would see the world, it is a shame it is not a majority but I believe the majority may not like to abide by what it sets out to say. Have a read and enjoy. Perhaps I'll change your mind, make a point you can use in an arguement.\n\nEither way, 3 pages is very short for this kind of work, so not much of your time lost if you don't like it.\n\nCheerio,\nAnd TPB FOREVER!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329a0f00f308001641cd20338a6835f53cf72e31","amp;dn":"Ode+to+Humanity+Part+1.doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329a0f00f308001641cd20338a6835f53cf72e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,154,15,0,243,8,0,22,65,205,32,51,138,104,53,245,60,247,46,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
