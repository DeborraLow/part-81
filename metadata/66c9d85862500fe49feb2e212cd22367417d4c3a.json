Bookends greatly simplifies these tasks. \n\nBookends can perform Internet searches to retrieve references and associated pdfs or web pages, or immediately find and import references for which you already have the pdf. \n\nVersatile groups (static, smart, and virtual), Term Lists (keywords, authors, etc.), reference cross-linking (links), multiple notecards per reference, tag clouds, and near-instantaneous live searches help organize and find information in your personal collection. \n\nHighly configurable displays let you view the reference information and attachments the way you want. Scan your word processor manuscripts to create publication-ready documents complete with bibliographies and footnotes.\n\nCompatible with Word (2004, 2008, and 2011), Mellel*, Apple Pages '08 and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“09, Nisus Writer Pro, and OpenOffice 3.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nOS X.4 and above\n\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c9d85862500fe49feb2e212cd22367417d4c3a","amp;dn":"Bookends+11.0+pre%5BK%5Dracked+with+sn+re-uploaded+by+request","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c9d85862500fe49feb2e212cd22367417d4c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,201,216,88,98,80,15,228,159,235,46,33,44,210,35,103,65,125,76,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
