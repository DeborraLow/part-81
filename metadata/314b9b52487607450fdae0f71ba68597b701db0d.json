All of this at the press of a key combination.\n\nApptivate 2.0 introduces hotkey sequences, which are simply a sequence of key combinations. In previous versions of Apptivate, you could only bind an item to one key combination/hotkey. In Apptivate 2.0, it's possible to bind one item to something like ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€™Ã†â€™A + T, and another item to ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€™Ã†â€™A + H. To activate one of the items, you simply press the key combinations in order: first ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€™Ã†â€™A and then either T or H.\nThis greatly simplifies your key combinations if you've got a lot of items.\n\nApptivate also includes a preference for hiding the application if it's active when the hotkey is pressed. You can also take a quick look at an application by pressing and holding the hotkey; when the hotkey is released, the application is hidden.\n\nManual\n1. Unzip and move .app to Applications folder\n2. Enjoy!!!\n\nDO NOT UPDATE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:314b9b52487607450fdae0f71ba68597b701db0d","amp;dn":"Apptivate+2.0+%28Mac+App+Store%29+%28K%5C%27racked%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"314b9b52487607450fdae0f71ba68597b701db0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,75,155,82,72,118,7,69,15,218,224,247,27,166,133,151,183,1,219,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
