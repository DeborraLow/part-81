Filming began on March 28, 2009, in Rio de Janeiro, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, and the film was released on August 13, 2010.\n\nThe film is about a group of elite mercenaries, tasked with a mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator. It pays tribute to the blockbuster action films of the 1980s and early 1990s, and stars an array of action veterans from those decades, including Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Jet Li, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger (the latter two in cameo roles), as well as more recent stars such as Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Steve Austin.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, opening at number one at the U.S. box office.It also opened at number one in the United Kingdom and China.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee\n \nMore info in the NFO.. \n\nVideo Format                     : MPEG-4\nWidth                            : 608 pixels\nHeight                           : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio    : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps \nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 6B\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 132 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90211c3bc3cbd68a57ac7973b8b170be6da7c3d6","amp;dn":"The+Expendables+%5BScreen-Mp4-Mp3%5D+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90211c3bc3cbd68a57ac7973b8b170be6da7c3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,33,28,59,195,203,214,138,87,172,121,115,184,177,112,190,109,167,195,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
