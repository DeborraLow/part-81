The film was shot entirely on Super 8 Plus-X reversal stock, and while the gags are certainly inspired by the work of Chaplin and Buster Keaton, they are all original (or at least an old, well used gag in an original context.) Production began in late 2007 and finished June 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d356f3995f10789ac400dbf8fcf041e62795a7","amp;dn":"The+Worthless+Virtuoso+%28Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d356f3995f10789ac400dbf8fcf041e62795a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,211,86,243,153,95,16,120,154,196,0,219,248,252,240,65,230,39,149,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
