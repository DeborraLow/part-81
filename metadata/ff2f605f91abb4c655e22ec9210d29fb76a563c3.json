That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\nToday's offering: DC from Chain Gang War, to Crimson Avenger\n\nNo time for cover collages today\n\nThe range is appropriate as I imagine a chain gang war could produce a lot of crimson folks who might want revenge. (ahem)\n\n     As usual I have everything of DC that has been scanned, and some Pre and or Post DC comics for characters or series DC has published which have also been published by others. \n\n     I've got some Humanoids graphic novel translations that DC did not distribute on the theory that they might have if the joint venture had succeeded, and that if you like some you might like others.\n\n    The CMX Manga in this range is not all scanned or at least I could not find all volumes, so I have scanlations as substitutes for some volumes. Not all the translated manga series DC published were complete. When DC stopped doing CMX, some were in progress. I will always include scanlations or other publishers translations of volumes beyond DC-CMX if I can find them. \n     I put in a  bunch of Adam Hughes art collections to make up for the unscanned DC published collection I substituted original 2000AD issues for the Indigo story DC published but which is not scanned in that form.  I have a few  alternate takes on Cinderella to go with the Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® re-imagining of that character. A couple of old Red Circle issues of The Comet, We have Crack Comics which was published by Quality. Some of the characters i those comics became DC character, at least once or twice. One, &quot;The Clock&quot; got no more than a passing mention that he was dead, but others have actually been used. Poor Clock, his time ran out. He had looked forward to retirement to unwind, but it was not to be.  It was his time to go. He stopped. The bell tolled for him. He had been such a handy guy too. I was always glad to see his face. He could be a bit of an alarmist though. And of course employers were not too pleased with staff who watched him all the time. Never slow, never fast, he was always on hand at the right moment. Some people said he was wound too tight, maybe at times he was, but so many people ran their lives by what he said, it's understandable.  He always had a spring in his step. Now he'll never ring me up again. I guess I won't miss that.\n \n \nEnjoy!\n\nChain Gang War 01-12 (1993-1994)\nChaland Anthology v1 (Humanoids\nChallengers of the Fantastic (Amalgam(06-1997)\nChallengers of the Unknown Chronology.txt\nChallengers of the Unknown DC Archives 01-02-remix with real extras flattermann'\nChallengers of the Unknown v1 01-87 (1958-1978)\nChallengers of the Unknown v2 01-08 (1991)\nChallengers of the Unknown v3 01-18 (1997-1998)\nChallengers of the Unknown v4 01-06 (2004)\nChampion Sports 01-03 (1973)\nChaos Effect, The-Enki Bilal (Humanoids(2005)\nChase 01-09, 1,000,000 (1998)\nCheckmate DCP Archive Edition\nCheckmate v1 01-33 (1988-1991)\nCheckmate v2 01-31 (2006-2008)\nChiaroscuro 01-10 (Vertigo(1995-1996)\nChikyu Misaki v1-03 (CMX\nChild of the Storm 01-02 (2008-2009)\nChildren's Crusade, The 01-02 (Vertigo(2003-2004)\nChill, The ctc (Vertigo2009)\nChristmas with the Super-Heroes 01-02 (1988-89)\nChronos 01-11 (1998)\nChuck 01-06 (WS(2008)\nCinder and Ashe 01-04 (1998)\nCinderella-Fables are Forever 01-06 (Veritgo(2011\nCinderella-From Fabletown With Love 01-06 (Vertigo(2010)\n\nAlternate Cinderellas\nGrimm Fairy Tales 002-Cinderella-Zenoscope\nGrimm Fairy Tales 045-Cinderella Revisited-Zenoscope\nClassics Illustrated Junior 503-Cinderella ctc(12-1953)\nFour Color Comics s2 0272-Walt Disney's Cinderella (Dell(c.1950)\nGrimms Fairy Tales-Cinderella.txt\n\nCinnamon-El Ciclo 01-05 (2003-2004)\nCipher v01-11 (CMX v3 is scanlated\nCity People Notebook-Will Eisner's TPB\nCity of Tomorrow 01-06 (WS(2005)\nClash 01-03 (1991-1992)\nClassical Medley v1-2 (CMX\nClaw the Unconquered v1 01-12 (1975-1976)\nClaw the Unconquered v1 013 Unpublished v1\nClaw the Unconquered v1 014 Unpublished v1\nClaw the Unconquered v2 01-06 (2006-2007)\nClockwerx T1 Genesis (scanlation(2008)\nClubbing (DC Minx(2007)\nCodename Knockout 01-23 (Vertigo(2001-03)\nThe Comet 01-02 (Red Circle(1983-1984)\nThe Comet Annual 001\nThe Comet v1 01-18 (DC-!mpact(1991-1992)\nComic Cavalcade Xmas Card.jpg\nComic Cavalcade-WWoman, Flash, GL 01-63 (1943-1954)\nComicology v1-The Kingdom Come Companion\nComics the Golden Age-The History of DC Comics ctc (1985)\nComix a History of Comic Books In America By Les Daniels ctc\n\nComplete Indigo Prime (Substitute for DC Edition(2000AD\n2000AD Indigo issues - all but one of the original comics the stories were in. 39 issues\nIndigo Prime 02-05 (Scanner archives)\nIndigo Prime and Tyranny Rex 01-05 - most are remixes\n\nCongo Bill 01-04 (Vertigo(1999-2000)\nCongo Bill 01-07 (1954-1955)\nCongorilla 01-04 (1992-1993)\nConjurors 01-03 (1999)\nConnor Hawke-Dragon's Blood 01-06 (2007)\nConqueror of the Barren Earth 01-04 (1985)\nConstantine The Official Movie Adaptation (Vertigo(2004)- the other Constantine titles will under Hellblazer\nContract With God, A-Will Eisner (2000)\nCool World 01-04 and Movie Adaption (1992)\nCops 01-15 (1988-1989)\nCosmic Boy 01-04 (1987)\nCosmic Odyssey 01-04 (1988)\nCotton Candy Autopsy, A (Piranha Press(1990)\n\nCountdown\nCountdown Origins DCP Archive Edition\nCountdown Presents Lord Havok and the Extremists 01-06 (2008)\nCountdown Presents-The Search For Ray Palmer 6 issues (2007-2008)\nCountdown Special Kamandi (2008)\nCountdown Special OMAC (2008)\nCountdown Special-Eclipso (2008)\nCountdown Special-Jimmy Olsen (2008)\nCountdown Special-New Gods (2008)\nCountdown Special-The Atom 001 (2008)\nCountdown Special-The Atom 002 (2008)\nCountdown Special-The Flash (2007)\nCountdown Teasers\nCountdown to Adventure v1 01-08 (2007-2008)\nCountdown to Infinite Crisis 80pg\nCountdown to Mystery v1 01-08 (2007-2008)\n\nThis is next sometimes listed as v2 but the other Wildstorm 8 issue countdown is unrelated, so I say no.\nCountdown 51-01 (2007-2008) - yes this is numbered in reverse.\nCountdown-Arena v1 01-04 (2008)\n\nCountdown 01-08 (WS(2000-2001) - unrelated to above countdownn\nCoup D'Etat 01-04, Afterward (WS\nCosmic Odyssey 01-04 (1988)\n\nCover Run-The DC Comics Art of Adam Hughes-unscanned here's a substitute for the DC book\nAdam Hughes Sketchbook (Kaleidoscope-Spanish\nAdam Hughes-4 Misc Covers\nAdam Hughes-Assorted Art 136p\nAdam Hughes-Assorted Art 905p\nAdam Hughes-Best covers\nAdam Hughes-Catwoman Batgirl Batman\nAdam Hughes-Christmas\nAdam Hughes-Comicartcommunity.com\nAdam Hughes-Desktops\nAdam Hughes-Drawing, Doodles, &amp;
