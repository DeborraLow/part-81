Our music ministry took us literally all over the world, including several trips behind the Iron Curtain before the wall came down. Prior to officially being Farrell &amp; Farrell, we had several groups, including the one that made our first recording, Millennium.\n \n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a67760f9e553151555066c44dea0a777026b29bb","amp;dn":"Farrell+%26+Farrell+%28Bob+%26+Jane+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a67760f9e553151555066c44dea0a777026b29bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,119,96,249,229,83,21,21,85,6,108,68,222,160,167,119,2,107,41,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
