Tom shares ideas from his book on how to prepare for and deal with the coming economic/martial law crises.\n\nFrom his book description: Productive people everywhere understand that their lives are being wrung of every drop of value, but it is hard to put your finger on why and how. Or more importantly, what to do about it. Yet, even though there are so few of us, we still hold all the cards. You just have to know how to play them.\n\n\nI\\'ve compiled this video from the individual segments\n\nTom\\'s book can be ordered from his website: http://www.starvingthemonkeys.com/\n\n(To me, the video seems to be equally divided between original, useful advice/info and just plain old common sense. I have not read the book yet or I would comment on it as well. Anyone who has read it, please feel free to share your thoughts.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6b7d5f5e151c40b42f512b47ff9b8e45fbc6fc","amp;dn":"Tom+Baugh+-+Starving+The+Monkeys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6b7d5f5e151c40b42f512b47ff9b8e45fbc6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,107,125,95,94,21,28,64,180,47,81,43,71,255,155,142,69,251,198,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
