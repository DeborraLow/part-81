Written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Terry and Rachel Dodson the series deals with teen pregnancy.  The basic concept was created by Bill Jemas and Joe Quesada.\n\nTrouble was originally considered by Marvel's editorial group as the possible origin of Spider-Man, but after the book was not received very well by many comic book fans the story was declared not &quot;official&quot; Marvel continuity.  It was also meant to re-popularize romance comics but failed.  \n\nAll issues of Trouble featured photo covers by French photographer Phillippe Biabolos in the style of teen romance novels, which is unusual for an American comic book series, with cover design by Joe Quesada. \n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05aca8edba777620148f4441156f1fbbeaaae0e9","amp;dn":"Trouble+%28Epic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05aca8edba777620148f4441156f1fbbeaaae0e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,172,168,237,186,119,118,32,20,143,68,65,21,111,31,187,234,170,224,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
