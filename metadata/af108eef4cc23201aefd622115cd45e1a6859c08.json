It was made with a program called BDtoAVCHD. This is from a 34GB BR disc. It was compressed with X264 in a 2 pass encode on  a Quad core processor and 4GB of memory. It took 7hr and 30 min to complete. The process is completely automatic , you just pick the size you want the final file to be. I then used IMG burn to burn to DVD and tested it on a Samsung C6500 BR player. It reacted the same as HD-R-US discs and started playing after insertion. There is no menu, but there are chapters with BR rips, but not with MKV to AVCHD. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is from an MKV file please check the NFO file.

Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, Daemon Tools virtual drive can be used to mount the image file, or PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named &quot;00000.m2ts&quot;. Once extracted, if you decide to save the movie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-\n\nClick &quot;Write files/folders to disc&quot;\nAdd both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders\nSelect the Options Tab-\nData Type = MODE1/2048\nFile System = UDF\nUDF Revision = 2.50\nMake sure that the &quot;Recurse Subdirectories&quot; field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.\nInsert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.\n\nThe relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack is free to download, but there are numerous others\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t******************************************************************************************************\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeedback is a must if I am to post more like this. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Maybe they will rise again. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af108eef4cc23201aefd622115cd45e1a6859c08","amp;dn":"THE+TOURIST+2010+BLURAY+720P+X264+DTS-TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af108eef4cc23201aefd622115cd45e1a6859c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,16,142,239,76,194,50,1,174,253,98,33,21,205,69,225,166,133,156,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
