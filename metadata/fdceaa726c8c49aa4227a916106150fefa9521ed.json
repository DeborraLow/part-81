I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him. I would be the one to call cut because I was like, 'oh I cant do this!' I feel so horrible. But I know it's a job. [Russell and me] understand what our work is.&quot;\n\nA lyric video with pictures was uploaded to Perry'saccount on July 26, 2010. A 30-second snippet was released on August 5, 2010.
