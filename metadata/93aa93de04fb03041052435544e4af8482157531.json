So, Love is the unseen undercurrent binding all the four values. It can be summarised thus: Love in thoughts is Sathya (Truth); Love in feelings is Shanthi (Peace); \n\n\nLove in action is Dharma (Righteousness) and Love in understanding is Ahimsa (Non-Violence).

Love, or absence of Love makes one an animal, man or God.\n\nOm Sri Sai Ram....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93aa93de04fb03041052435544e4af8482157531","amp;dn":"Sri+Satya+Sai+Baba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93aa93de04fb03041052435544e4af8482157531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,170,147,222,4,251,3,4,16,82,67,85,68,228,175,132,130,21,117,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
