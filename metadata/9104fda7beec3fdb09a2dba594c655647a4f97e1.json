The       \n    Normans spread south in the 11th century, winning        \n    control of southern Italy and the island of Sicily.       \n    There they created their most prosperous kingdom, where    \n    Christianity and Islam co-existed in relative harmony     \n    and mutual tolerance. It became a great centre of        \n    medieval culture and learning.                            \n                                                               \n    But events in the Middle East provoked the more           \n    aggressive side of the Norman character. In 1095, the    \n    Normans enthusiastically answered the Pope's call for     \n    holy war against Islam and joined the first crusade.       \n    They lay siege to Jerusalem and eventually helped win     \n    back the holy city from the muslims. This bloody         \n    conquest left a deep rift between Christianity and        \n    Islam which is still being felt to this day.               \n                                                              \n                                                               \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9104fda7beec3fdb09a2dba594c655647a4f97e1","amp;dn":"The.Normans.2010.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9104fda7beec3fdb09a2dba594c655647a4f97e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,4,253,167,190,236,63,219,9,162,219,165,148,198,85,100,122,79,151,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
