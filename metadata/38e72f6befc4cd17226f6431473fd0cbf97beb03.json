This is a DVDrip, but have in mind that the film was made in 1966.\n\nThis is a collection of stories about the Shinsengumi - a special police force of the late shogunate period. You'll see the core of the corps - Commanders Kondo Isami and Serizawa Kamo, Vice-Commanders Hijikata Toshizou and Yamanami Keisuke, captains Okita Souji, Saitou Hajime, Nagakura Shinpachi, Harada Sanosuke and others, and follow some stories about their life and death - mostly fictional, I suppose, but based on primary sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e72f6befc4cd17226f6431473fd0cbf97beb03","amp;dn":"Shinsengumi+Keppuroku+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e72f6befc4cd17226f6431473fd0cbf97beb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,231,47,107,239,196,205,23,34,111,100,49,71,63,208,203,249,123,235,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
