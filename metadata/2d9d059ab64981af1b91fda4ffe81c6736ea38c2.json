Some of you may be wondering, so here's a little history. In     |\n|   1991, a group of people from Bristol, some previously members of a group   |\n|   called The Wild Bunch, came together to form a band called Massive         |\n|   Attack. The group was led by Robert Del Naja, known also as 3D. They       |\n|   recorded and released an album called Blue Lines, which proved itself to   |\n|   be a benchmark album of the 90s, and one of the greatest hip-hop albums    |\n|   ever. But hip-hop was almost too narrow a definition for it - while it     |\n|   was based in the hip-hop style of making music, it also incorporated       |\n|   chillout, and a little psychedelica. The critics soon labelled it 'trip    |\n|   -hop' - a term referring to chill-out hip-hop that - sterotypically - is   |\n|   listened to by stoners. With Massive Attack, Tricky, Sneaker Pimps,        |\n|   Portishead, and DJ Shadow as its leading lights, it has proved itself to   |\n|   be an incredibly fertile genre, with these acts and other, lesser-known    |\n|   ones releasing many great albums. Crucially, there's been very little      |\n|   rubbish released in the name of trip-hop, which is the precise reason      |\n|   I'd say it's my favourite genre of music.                                  |\n|                                                                              |\n|   This album, released in 1994, has proven itself to be one of the pillars   |\n|   of the genre. The band, essentially, is multi-instrumentalist Geoff        |\n|   Barrow (the tape-op for Massive Attack when Blue Lines was made), and      |\n|   singer Beth Gibbons. Yes, singer. This is an album steeped in hip-hop      |\n|   that features NO rapping whatsoever. All the instruments are recorded      |\n|   live, too, with the exception of the drums on It Could Be Sweet. So        |\n|   leave the prejudice at home.                                               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   At least, most people THINK it's just Beth Gibbons and Geoff Barrow.       |\n|   Adrian Utley certianly deserves a mention though. Guitarist recently ran   |\n|   a style file on him, and he once played with Art Blakey And The Jazz       |\n|   Messengers, which should tell you something about his ability. The         |\n|   guitar parts on this album (although he is not on every track) are         |\n|   great. Subtle, and not exactly technically taxing, but great. There's      |\n|   some great use of chord inversions throughout, too, which I understand     |\n|   was partly down to his input. But I may be wrong there. He also plays      |\n|   bass on Pedastel, possibly the best bassline on the album. And his         |\n|   guitar work on Glory Box constitutes the album's high point.               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   That's not to talk down Beth Gibbons or Geoff Barrow. Beth was the star    |\n|   turn when this album was released; her voice was soon being called 'the    |\n|   most beautiful ever', and was drawing comparisons with Nina Simone,        |\n|   Billie Holiday, Dusty Springfield, and just about any female soul singer   |\n|   you'd care to mention. I think that's a little too superlative, but        |\n|   she's certainly got some voice on her - fragile, tender, and soulful.      |\n|   Dusty Springfield is a fairly good comparison, as is - with hindsight -    |\n|   Eva Cassidy. Her lyrics are a plus point, too. Geoff Barrow? Well, it's    |\n|   hard to tell where his input starts or stops, to be honest, but the band   |\n|   was his idea, and he has writer credits on every song, so he's not         |\n|   exactly dispensable.                                                       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The quality of this album, and its ability to crossover to fans of any     |\n|   genre, is demonstrated by the fact that a live version of Glory Box,       |\n|   from a later album, is played on Classic FM, and on their TV channel. In   |\n|   fairness, Glory Box is the song that displays the least hip-hop            |\n|   influences, but I heard them play an orchestral version of Mysterons       |\n|   once, too, with the scratching left in.                                    |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The album only has one flaw - it dips in the middle. Mysterons and Glory   |\n|   Box are both amazing. Sour Times and It Could Be Sweet, also. But, while   |\n|   there's nothing wrong with tracks 5 through 9, they don't stand up to      |\n|   what's around them. That's not to say that they're bad, though. It may     |\n|   be because Glory Box casts such a long shadow. Although, you'll find       |\n|   these tracks sound great either in your headphones just as you're going    |\n|   to sleep, or when you've just had 2 or 3 glasses of red wine and are       |\n|   feeling in a very laid back, poetic kind of mood. (Incidentally, I find    |\n|   red wine always makes trip-hop better. :) )                                |\n|                                                                              |\n|   This album comes thoroughly recommended to any fans of hip-hop (that's     |\n|   hip-hop music, not rap vocals), female soul vocalists, or anybody          |\n|   unfamiliar with trip-hop and who wants to experiment. It's not the best    |\n|   trip-hop album ever, but it's as good an introduction as any.              |\n|                                                                              |\n|   4/5.
