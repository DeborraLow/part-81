I converted the .m4a files (original files from iTunes) into lossless wav, then from wav into FLAC.\n\nI also included an alternative version to &quot;Sunshine (Adagio in D Minor)&quot;. This alternative version doesn't have any vocals like the official iTunes version has. I am not sure of the source of it, but it's lossless.\n\nEnjoy...a simple thanks would be nice :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c124fb9f90f806dcadcec4549df07deed209a6f4","amp;dn":"Sunshine+Official+OST+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c124fb9f90f806dcadcec4549df07deed209a6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,36,251,159,144,248,6,220,173,206,196,84,157,240,125,238,210,9,166,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
