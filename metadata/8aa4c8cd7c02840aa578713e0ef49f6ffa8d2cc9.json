So far so good, so we've decided to take it one step further. This update brings a new button that allows you to view the price history graphs that are normally found on the official Grand Exchange. You are given the options of 30, 90 and 180 day graphs.\n\nThe feature seems to work really well with the exception of how slow the RuneScape website is. Hopefully Jagex release a &quot;lite feed&quot; of the GE like they did of the Hiscores. Until then there isn't much we can do about the speed.\n\nChanges and Fixes:\n+ New GE price graph button in the Item Database lookup.\n+ Fixed a bug that caused SK to crash after 60 seconds from opening.\n+ Fixed a bug in Advent Log Center that caused SK to crash.\n+ Fixed bug allowing you to change screenshots while uploading in Viewer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa4c8cd7c02840aa578713e0ef49f6ffa8d2cc9","amp;dn":"SwiftKit+-+Runolkit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa4c8cd7c02840aa578713e0ef49f6ffa8d2cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,164,200,205,124,2,132,10,165,120,113,62,14,244,159,111,250,141,44,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
