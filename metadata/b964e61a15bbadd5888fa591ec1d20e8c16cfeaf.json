The only exception to this is the compilation of early work which became known as Garage Flower. Band members have renounced that work as insignificant, but I have included it anyway.\n\nI have also included the live performance at Glasgow Green from 1990, which is regarded as being one of the best ever Roses gigs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b964e61a15bbadd5888fa591ec1d20e8c16cfeaf","amp;dn":"Stone+Roses+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b964e61a15bbadd5888fa591ec1d20e8c16cfeaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,100,230,26,21,187,173,213,136,143,165,145,236,29,32,232,193,108,254,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
