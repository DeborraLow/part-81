This belief is not only absurd, but is cruel and immoral.\n\nIt is interesting to note that all these doctrines cannot be found in the Old Testament or in the Gospels or in the teachings of Jesus and the prophets before him. These were all innovations of the pagan Christianity of the 4th century and beyond.\n\nIslam, of course, rejects all of those false Christian doctrines. In Islam a newborn starts with a blank page or an empty record. Even during his childhood his record stays empty. He starts registering the good deeds and  the bad deeds (sins) only after he reaches adulthood and becomes responsible for his actions.\n\nThe last title in the upload (#19) gives an introduction to the &quot;way of salvation&quot; in Islam.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe16fdd2589b0118ea62d8f73ddfcda7f4bdd2d","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Trinity%2C+Incarnation+%26+Atonement+-+Collection+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe16fdd2589b0118ea62d8f73ddfcda7f4bdd2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,225,111,221,37,137,176,17,142,166,45,143,115,221,252,218,127,75,221,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
