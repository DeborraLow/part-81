Because I Noticed\n\nThat Someone Did A Lot Of Video Editing (Very Time Consuming) By Putting These\n\nEpisodes Together (Editing Out Comercials) The Show Was Always Leaving Us In\n\nSuspense Sometimes Until The Show Was Scheduled To Run Again. As Most Of The\n\nEpisodes Were Broken Up Into 3 Or 4 Parts. (MY HATS OFF TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS\n\nWHO DID ALL THIS EDITING)!!!  EXCELLENT JOB !!!\n\n\n\nFurther: These Are The (ORIGINAL) Shows (Explanation Below) &quot;Underdogs Super Energy\n\nPill&quot;\n\n\n                       // Underdogs Super Energy Pill //\n\nThe &quot;Underdog Super Energy Pill&quot; Was First Introduced In Episode 10. (1x09 - 1x12) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œZOTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ_PT 2 Of  4_(10-??-1964)\n\nBefore taking one, he would often Say: &quot;The Secret Compartment Of My Ring I Fill / With An Underdog Super Energy Pill&quot;.\n\nSeveral Episodes Show Underdog Losing The Ring, &amp; Being Powerless. Since He Must Take Another Pill As His Super Powers Began To Fail, He Would Say &quot;Without My Super Energy Pill / I grow Weaker &amp; Weaker &amp; Weaker Still&quot;.\n\nWhen The Series Was Syndicated (Re-Run) In The 1980s &amp; 1990s, The Scenes Of Him Taking His Energy Pill Were Edited Out.\n\nAnimation Fans Lambast This As A Form Of  Political Correctness, As They Believe The Scenes Were Removed In An Attempt To Prevent Any Glorification Of Drug Use.\n\n\nSo Here In These Shows Beginning With Episode (1x09 - 1x12) We See Underdog Taking\n\nHis Energy Pill When Needed. (You May Not Want Your Children Watching These\n\nOriginal Shows)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1350a73808bd0d74c8059d5f54ce5326b197139","amp;dn":"Underdog+Show-Animated-%28Avi%29-%2803.68-Gb%29-%28010hrs31mins31secs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1350a73808bd0d74c8059d5f54ce5326b197139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,53,10,115,128,139,208,215,76,128,89,213,245,76,229,50,107,25,113,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
