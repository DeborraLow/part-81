They spend the night celebrating with Terry's girlfriend, Candice (Brittany Daniel), and his assistant, Denise (Crystal Reed). During the party, one of Terry's employees, Ray (Neil Hopkins), welcomes Jarrod to L.A., thinking he has moved there to join Terry's special effects company. During a private argument about whether or not they should move to L.A., Elaine reveals that she is pregnant. Early the next morning, bright blue lights descend from the sky, entrancing anyone who looks at them. The light turns their eyes milky white and inflames blood vessels so that they stand up on the skin. Held captive by the light, humans are immobilized and abducted by the machines. Ray suffers this fate, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him. Jarrod returns to normal shortly after. He and Terry decide to investigate the light from the roof of the highrise, where they see several alien ships descend over the blue lights and vacuum up thousands of entranced people. Locked out on the roof, they are almost captured by flying machines, but Elaine opens the door from inside. She is temporarily mesmerized, but Jarrod saves her.\n\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 12 November 2010 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n* Eric Balfour as Jarrod\n* Scottie Thompson as Elaine\n* Brittany Daniel as Candice\n* Crystal Reed as Denise\n* Neil Hopkins as Ray\n* David Zayas as Oliver\n* Donald Faison as Terry\n* J.
