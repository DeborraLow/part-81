They go in search of some dope and are accidentally deported to Mexico where in their desperation to get home they agree to drive a van back to the States so they can get back in time for a gig they are due to play. Unaware of the properties from which the van is constructed they make their way back having aquired a couple of female hitch-hikers whilst all the time avoiding the cops whom they are not even aware are following them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b8de218ab049a9c87643c45fa9bcb0929ee749e","amp;dn":"Cheech+and+Chong%5C%27s+Up+in+Smoke+1978+DVDRip.XViD.AC3-rickity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b8de218ab049a9c87643c45fa9bcb0929ee749e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,141,226,24,171,4,154,156,135,100,60,69,250,155,203,9,41,238,116,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
