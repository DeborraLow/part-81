Since the band's formation, they have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, making them one of the largest grossing rock bands in recent years. The band has released three consecutive studio albums that have debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe most recent cover version was by American rock band Disturbed, from their third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists. The song became the fourth single from that album. Vocalist David Draiman commented that the aim of covering the song was, &quot;taking a song that's absolutely nothing like us and making it our own.&quot;\nIt was accompanied by a music video animated by Todd McFarlane, known for his work with the Spawn comic book series and the creator of Spider-Man Anti-Hero Venom. McFarlane had previously animated the music videos for the songs &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; by Korn and &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; by Pearl Jam. According to McFarlane, the music video is &quot;a big view of the corporate world and how it all ties into just one big beast for me... The world is run by one giant thing, which is driven by greed and lust.&quot;\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe video starts out with The Guy, Disturbed's mascot, falling to earth. It then shows military forces sporting a dollar sign within a circle of white that is within a field of red, followed by legions of black-clad soldiers reminiscent of Adolf Hitler's Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad), belonging to different countries. The video then shows The Guy, escaping bondage from chains, as the military forces continue to assault cities. Later on, leaders of various nations of the world are shown sitting at a table with the same dollar sign on it. Eventually The Guy confronts some soldiers, who sport patches with the dollar sign symbol, and stirs the people around the world to revolt and kill the soldiers, and then flags of various nations of the world are shown, with the final flag sporting the dollar sign. The Guy then leads the rebels to the United Nations Headquarters  where they slaughter the U.N. representatives and finally the overweight businessman who, when destroyed by The Guy, explodes into dollar bills.\n\n\nLyrics\n\nI must have dreamed a thousand dreams\nBeen haunted by a million screams\nBut I can hear the marching feet\nThey're moving into the street\n\nNow, did you read the news today?\nThey say the danger has gone away\nBut I can see the fire's still alight\nThey're burning into the night\n\nThere's too many men, too many people\nMaking too many problems\nAnd there's not much love to go around\nCan't you see this is a land of confusion?\n\nThis is the world we live in\nAnd these are the hands we're given\nUse them and let's start trying\nTo make it a place worth living in\n\nOh, superman, where are you now?\nWhen everything's gone wrong somehow?\nThe men of steel, these men of power\nAre losing control by the hour\n\nThis is the time, this is the place\nSo we look for the future\nBut there's not much love to go around\nTell me why this is a land of confusion\n\nThis is the world we live in\nAnd these are the hands we're given\nUse them and let's start trying\nTo make it a place worth living in\n\nI remember long ago\nWhen the sun was shining\nAnd all the stars were bright all through the night\nIn the wake of this madness, as I held you tight\nSo long ago\n\nI won't be coming home tonight\nMy generation will put it right\nWe're not just making promises\nThat we know we'll never keep\n\nThere's too many men, too many people\nMaking too many problems\nAnd there's not much love to go round\nCan't you see this is a land of confusion?\n\nNow, this is the world we live in\nAnd these are the hands we're given\nUse them and let's start trying\nTo make it a place worth fighting for\n\nThis is the world we live in\nAnd these are the names we're given\nStand up and let's start showing\nJust where our lives are going to\n\n\nDetails\n\nRelease Date: October 2, 2006\nLanguage: English\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 83.0 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 46s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2,434 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nDuration                         : 4mn 46s\nBit rate                         : 2,045 Kbps\nWidth                            : 960 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStream size                      : 68.2 MiB (82%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nDuration                         : 4mn 46s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 13.1 MiB (16%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49f55ee5faa9d67a4d7f223b1ac3c0a41a09ca3a","amp;dn":"Land+of+Confusion+-+Disturbed+%28MHD%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49f55ee5faa9d67a4d7f223b1ac3c0a41a09ca3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,245,94,229,250,169,214,122,77,127,34,59,26,195,192,164,26,9,202,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
