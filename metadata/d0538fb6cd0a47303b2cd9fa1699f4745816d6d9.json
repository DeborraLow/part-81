Harry Smilac is a down-on-his-luck music manager who is having a hard time attracting talent and booking gigs for his band, Kicks (The most recent of the gigs is a Dairy Queen opening!!). When making arrangements for a campaign fund-raiser, he mistakes Rick Roberts, a professional wrestler, for a musician and hires him. At that moment he becomes a wrestling manager and starts to book matches for him and his teammate Tonga Tom. The team is a success, and Harry decides to take his wrestlers and his band on a &quot;Rock n' Wrestling&quot; tour. The tour is a success, and Harry feels what it is like to be a winner again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0538fb6cd0a47303b2cd9fa1699f4745816d6d9","amp;dn":"Body+Slam+%281986%29+%28VHSRIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0538fb6cd0a47303b2cd9fa1699f4745816d6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,83,143,182,205,10,71,48,59,44,217,250,22,153,244,116,88,22,214,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
