Brown has also worked with organizations such as Promise Keepers and Campus Crusade for Christ, and was a pastor in San Diego.[1] He toured extensively internationally. Before recording songs and touring with dozens of artists, he met a young, unfamiliar artist, Steve Camp, fresh out of high school, who would also sing backup while playing acoustic guitar with Brown on I'm Not Religious, I Love the Lord, just the year before going on his own, where he had a successful solo career. Occasionally, while his 35+ year friendship with the future label-mate (Camp) escalates, he went on tour with him, singing a bunch of songs, at the same time, traveling on the road with him, as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8313587e8836882d616ecf7e637c9b2340520fa","amp;dn":"Scott+Wesley+Brown+-+The+Scott+Wesley+Brown+Collection+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8313587e8836882d616ecf7e637c9b2340520fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,49,53,135,232,131,104,130,214,22,236,247,230,55,201,178,52,5,32,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
