Hustling\nas hard as the day is long, Texas' own rapper slash hustler Lil' C has\nbeen grinding hard on the MixUnit scene for some 3 years or so solid.\nDropping a slew of Texas-centric compilations sprinkled with Lil' C\nexclusives as well as full-length solo mixtape projects, C has been\ngettin' his name out the good ol' straight-out-the-trunk way, putting in\nthat work in mom &amp; pops all over Texas and wherever they f$%k with that\nTrill sh*t.\n\nWith this new release Lil' C takes his mantra literally and went in the\nlab for a couple good months and came out that bitch with this brand new\nsolo mixtape, featuring all new and original material from the king of\nthe Keep On Stackin' regime. C cranks this new mixtape out with features\nand verses from Z-Ro, Killa Kyleon, Fat Pat, J-Dawg, Young Capo and\nmore.\n\nCR-4-Life\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n01.Sittin So Low Feat. Fat Pat (Prod.
