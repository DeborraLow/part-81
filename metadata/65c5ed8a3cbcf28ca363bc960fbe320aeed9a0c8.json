The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!    \n\n\nLabel:\nMilestone Records\nCatalog#:\nM-47067\nFormat:\n2 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Vinyl, LP, Album\nCountry:\nUS\nReleased:\n1982\nGenre:\nJazz\nStyle:\n \nTracklist\nA1 \t\tStraight, No Chaser (Take 1) \t5:26 \t\nA2 \t\tStraight, No Chaser \t6:57 \t\nA3 \t\tDecidedly (Take 4) \t5:51 \t\nA4 \t\tDecidedly \t6:34 \t\nB1 \t\t'Round Midnight \t8:26 \t\nB2 \t\tRythm-A-Ning \t5:16 \t\nB3 \t\tSweet And Lovely \t7:14 \t\nC1 \t\tI Mean You (Take 1) \t6:21 \t\nC2 \t\tI Mean You (Take 2) \t6:29 \t\nC3 \t\tI Mean You \t6:54 \t\nD1 \t\t'Round Midnight (Progress) \t21:51 \t\nD2 \t\t'Round Midnight (As Issued) \t6:40 \t\nCredits\n\n    * Artwork By ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Phil Carroll\n    * Bass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wilbur Ware\n    * Drums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Shadow Wilson\n    * Engineer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jack Higgins\n    * Mastered By ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Danny Kopelson, George Horn\n    * Photography ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bob Parent\n    * Piano ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Thelonious Monk\n    * Producer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Orrin Keepnews\n    * Saxophone [Baritone] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gerry Mulligan\n\nNotes\n\nIncluding previously unreleased outtakes and versions from Mulligan Meets Monk (Riverside 247) including the extensive soloversion of 'Round Midnight.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c5ed8a3cbcf28ca363bc960fbe320aeed9a0c8","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk-Gerry+Mulligan+-+%5C%27Round+Midnight+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c5ed8a3cbcf28ca363bc960fbe320aeed9a0c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,197,237,138,60,188,242,140,163,99,188,150,15,190,50,10,238,217,160,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
