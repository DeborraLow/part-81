Mitchell, &quot;Biological Complexity and Integrative Pluralism (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Biology)&quot;\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press | ISBN 10: 0521520797 | 2003 | PDF | 260 pages | 1.03 MB\n\nThis collection of essays by a leading philosopher of science defends integrative pluralism as the best description for today's complexity of scientific inquiry. The tendency of some scientists to reduce all theories to a few fundamental laws of the most basic particles that populate our universe is not appropriate for the biological sciences, which study multi-component, multi-level, evolved complex systems. This book will be of interest to students and professionals in the philosophy of science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c109ecc890dfbef37d6422c1a1780be069bb54","amp;dn":"Biological+Complexity+and+Integrative+Pluralism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c109ecc890dfbef37d6422c1a1780be069bb54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,193,9,236,200,144,223,190,243,125,100,34,193,161,120,11,224,105,187,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
