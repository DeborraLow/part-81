The GParted application enables you to change the partition organization on a disk device while preserving the contents of the partitions.\n\nGParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables. Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted. \nGParted live 0.8.0-5\n\n * The underlying GNU/Linux operating system is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2010/Sep/01).\n * This release was created by live-build and live-boot 2 and live-config 2 were used. An extra boot parameter &quot;live-config&quot; was added so it works for live-config.\n\n -- Steven Shiau &lt;steven _at_ nchc org tw&gt;  Wed, 01 Sep 2010 06:17:00 +0800\n\nThis is GParted live 0.8.0-5.\nNew in this release:\n * The underlying GNU/Linux operating system is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2010/Sep/01).\n * Live-boot and live-config are used in this release. Live-initramfs is no more. Therefore if you manage the boot paramters by yourself, you have to put extra boot parameter &quot;live-config&quot; to make live-config to work.\n\nHomepage : http://gparted.sourceforge.net/index.php\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c274d27b116433317b60084370dce02dc34486fd","amp;dn":"gparted-live-0.8.0-5.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c274d27b116433317b60084370dce02dc34486fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,116,210,123,17,100,51,49,123,96,8,67,112,220,224,45,195,68,134,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
