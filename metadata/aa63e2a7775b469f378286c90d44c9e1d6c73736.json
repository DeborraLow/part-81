These asteroids also decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for space excavation, the asteroid is still heading towards the Earth. When the crew are launched into outer space, they are determined to destroy this asteroid.\n\nDVD Information+++++++++++\n+Format - NTSC Region 0 (Region Free)\n+Video - DVD5 (Compressed)\n+Audio - English, French\n+Subs - English\n+Aspect - Fullscreen (4:3)\n\nMenu+++++++\n+Yes\n              \nExtras/Special Features+++++++\n+Yes\n\nRemoved+++++++++\n+Advertisements, FBI Warnings, Trailers (were only Armageddon trailers)\n\nGeneral Information+++++++++\n+Copied Using Latest DVDFab Platinum\n+Compressed And Re-Encoded Using DVD-RB Pro + CCE\n+CCE Passes - 4\n+Other Stuff Is For Me To Know And For You To Wish You Knew :)\n\nI want to thank you for choosing one of my DVD torrents.
