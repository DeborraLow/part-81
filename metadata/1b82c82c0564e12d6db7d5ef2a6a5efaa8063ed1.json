The Blackpool band were still Lemmy-less when they made their debut in 1964 with a supremely raunchy version of Neil Sedaka's &quot;I Go Ape,&quot; which was anthologized in the '70s on Hard-Up Heroes, the British equivalent of Nuggets. They'd only record three other singles, all of which had Lemmy aboard on guitar. Although capable of generating respectably raunchy, modish heat, they had nothing in the way of original material. Their third single, interestingly, was a version of a Pete Townshend song called &quot;It's Alright,&quot; which sounds like a prototype for the much superior &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; (although, puzzlingly, the Who had already released &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; by the time the Rockin' Vickers' &quot;It's Alright&quot; appeared in March 1966). Who producer Shel Talmy liked the band and produced their final 45, a cover of the Kinks' &quot;Dandy,&quot; which actually made number 93 in the States (where it was far outpaced by Herman's Hermits' version) before the Vickers split in 1967. \n\nReview  by Richie Unterberger  Allmusic.com\nA very competent group with mod, Merseybeat, and R&amp;B leanings, the Rockin' Vickers never came close to carving a sound of their own. Combined with their lack of original material, that condemned them to trivia-question status in the very competitive days of the British Invasion. Complete: Its Alright! has both sides of all four of their 1964-1966 singles, plus six previously unreleased tracks; the crazed primitive guitar solo on &quot;I Go Ape&quot; is the undoubted highlight. \n\nThe Rockin' Vickers   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThe Rockin' Vickers were a 1960s English Rock and Roll band from Blackpool. They were originally called Rev Black and The Rockin' Vicars, then abbreviated to The Rockin' Vicars, but in order to have a chance to get more gigs or even a record contract, they changed their name to &quot;Rockin' Vickers&quot;. The band is most notable for having Lemmy, who went by the name Ian Willis at the time, later of Hawkwind and more famously MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead, as a guitarist (Lemmy did not start playing bass until joining Hawkwind). Their last single &quot;Dandy&quot; was produced by Shel Talmy.\n\nHistory\nFormed in 1963, the band built their reputation as did many other beat groups of the era, by covering R&amp;B and Beat standards, but soon became known for their unusually intense live shows and outlandish stage costumes, dressing as vicars and Sami. Although mainly popular as a local act around Blackpool, England, the Vicars also toured mainland Europe, being one of the earliest British rock bands to perform behind the Iron curtain when they played in Yugoslavia in the summer of 1965. They were particularly popular in Finland, where they recorded a single, a rocked up version of Zing Went The Strings of My Hearts. They released four single records. The band split in 1967.\n\nIn 1967, expatriate Blackpool musician Dave Rossall (ex-Bruce &amp; The Spiders), carrying on the tradition of the English band, formed his own Australian band called Rev Black and the Rockin' Vicars (1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1969). The Australian band went on to release four singles in its own right, toured extensively around Australia and made the Brisbane Top 40.\n\nLineup\n1963-1964: \nHarry &quot;Reverend Black&quot; Feeney - Lead Vocals\nKen Hardacre - Lead Guitar\nAlex Hamilton - Guitar\nPeter Moorhouse - Bass\nCyril &quot;Ciggy&quot; Shaw - Drums\n\n1964-1965: \nHarry &quot;Reverend Black&quot; Feeney - Lead Vocals\nIan Holdbrook - Guitar, Harmonica\nNicholas Gribbon - Guitar\nStephen &quot;Mogsy&quot; Morris - Bass\nCyril &quot;Ciggy&quot; Shaw - Drums\n\n1965-1967: \nHarry &quot;Reverend Black&quot; Feeney - Lead Vocals\nIan &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister - Guitar\nStephen Morris - Bass\nCyril &quot;Ciggy&quot; Shaw - Drums\n\nTracklist:\n01.
