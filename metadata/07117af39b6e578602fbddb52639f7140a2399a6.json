He takes the child on \nthe road with him to spite his wife, but months pass and still no word \ncomes to ask for the little girl back. Strangers to each other at first, \nfather and daughter drift aimlessly through the dusty towns of \nAustralia, sleeping rough and relying on odd jobs for food and money. \nBuster's resilience and trust slowly erode Macauley's resentment, and \nwhen he's finally able to get rid of her, he realises he can't let his \nshiralee go. In evocative prose that vividly conjures images of rural \nAustralia, The Shiralee reveal an understanding of the paradoxical \nnature of the burdens we carry, creates a moving portrait of fatherhood, \ntold with gruff humour and a gentle pathos. \n\nPerformerRead by James Condon. \n\nNotesComplete &amp;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ unabridged. \n\nLanguageEnglish \n\nISBN9781742145105 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07117af39b6e578602fbddb52639f7140a2399a6","amp;dn":"The+Shiralee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07117af39b6e578602fbddb52639f7140a2399a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,17,122,243,155,110,87,134,2,251,221,181,38,57,247,20,10,35,153,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
