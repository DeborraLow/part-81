The remaining songs are roughly equally divided between bluesy numbers and folky ones. The album features Bernard Butler (of Suede) on electric guitar, and Adam Jansch (Bert's son). &quot;Gypsy Dave&quot; is not the well-known folksong, but an instrumental duo with Dave Swarbrick, dedicated to him. It is probably the best track. Hope Sandoval (of Mazzy Star) sings the lead on &quot;All This Remains&quot;, and Loren Jansch takes the lead on &quot;The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood&quot;. &quot;Bright Sunny Morning&quot; is a solemn description of the fall of the World Trade Center.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f2e13b3c0ee88da480ed98dde0dc9c0c6d2fea","amp;dn":"Bert+Jansch...Edge+of+a+Dream%282002%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f2e13b3c0ee88da480ed98dde0dc9c0c6d2fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,242,225,59,60,14,232,141,164,128,237,152,221,224,220,156,12,109,47,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
