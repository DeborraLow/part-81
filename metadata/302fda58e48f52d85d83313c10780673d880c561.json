Half the world trade is processed in one way or another through tax havens.&quot; Shaxson is the author of the new book, &quot;Treasure Islands: Uncovering the Damage of Offshore Banking and Tax Havens.&quot;\n\n\n- As Congress Slashes EPA, Climate Funding, Author Mark Hertsgaard on &quot;Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth&quot;\n\nThe budget deal approved by Congress cuts $1.6 billion from the budget of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-a 16 percent decrease; reduces funding for a planned climate desk within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and eliminates the position of assistant to the president for energy and climate change. Ever since taking control of the House, Republican lawmakers have taken a number of steps to curtail the Obama administration's efforts to deal with climate change. We speak with investigative reporter Mark Hertsgaard, author of the new book, &quot;Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth.&quot;\n\n\n- &quot;A Beautiful Soul, A Big Heart&quot;: Italian Peace Activist Vittorio Arrigoni Slain by Militant Captors in Gaza Strip\n\nThe body of 36-year-old Italian peace activist Vittorio Arrigoni was found in Gaza shortly after his captors posted video of him blindfolded and bloodied. They had vowed to execute him unless their group's leader was freed from custody by Gaza's Hamas-led government. Arrigoni was a member of the International Solidarity Movement, a Palestinian-led movement that use nonviolent and direct-action methods to oppose the Israeli occupation. He had lived in Gaza since 2008 after arriving on a boat carrying humanitarian aid. We speak to Hawaida Arraf, a friend of Vittorio's and co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302fda58e48f52d85d83313c10780673d880c561","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+15+apr+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302fda58e48f52d85d83313c10780673d880c561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,47,218,88,228,143,82,216,93,131,49,60,16,120,6,115,216,128,197,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
