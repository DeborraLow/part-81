He also finds out the real reason it was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086. Most historians believe that Domesday is some kind of tax book for raising revenue, but Baxter has his own theory. He argues that it is about something far more important than money.\n\nTech Spec for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c64f2898f06a9033346c4e6f18dba1653381d49","amp;dn":"BBC+Domesday+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c64f2898f06a9033346c4e6f18dba1653381d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,100,242,137,143,6,169,3,51,70,196,230,241,141,186,22,83,56,29,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
