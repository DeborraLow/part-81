A very good songwriter, as he proved with his well-crafted, self-titled debut release. The downside to his craft is though his almost extreme, whispered laid-back vocal delivery. At times you just want to kick this guy up the backside to wake him out of his self-afflicted, depressing coma he's fallen into. Like the debut, All Maps Welcome is a slit-your-wrists outing. It should really come with a Government health warning sticker on it: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PLAY THIS CD IF YOU SUFFER FROM ANY FORM OF DEPRESSION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. When McRae does decide to lift the tempo, as on &quot;Silent Boulevard&quot;, you hear not only the best track on the album, but quite possibly the best track of McRae's career to date. Tom, some advice mate: Get a life, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and open those lungs up when you sing. You know it makes sense Tom.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d27c32ec876ad20f617a53b45c138c5758ac46","amp;dn":"Tom+McRae...All+Maps+Welcome%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d27c32ec876ad20f617a53b45c138c5758ac46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,210,124,50,236,135,106,210,15,97,122,83,180,92,19,140,87,88,172,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
