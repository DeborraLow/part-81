Nominated for his third Mercury Prize for his most recent album Tongue N' Cheek, Britain's fave rapper continues to go from strength to strength. From underground grime MC to fully fledged pop star, Rascal once again turned on the charm playing to a mammoth crowd at Glastonbury this year, abley assisted by Florence Welch for a rendition of their hit You've Got the (Dirtee) Love. He knows how to get the festival party started, so conserve some energy for his monster hits Dance Wiv' Me and Bonkers. Dizzee will play the Main Stage at both Reading and Leeds.\n\n*With no available info and at short notice, I am unable to provide the tracklisting for this set.Hopefully somebody else can post it and I'll add it to the description later.*\n\nSource: BBC iPlayer\nVideo Format: .FLV (Play with VLC or WMP Classic)\nAudio: 2ch stereo\nSize: 211MB\nLength: 36:17","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6416bd45bd85b448c651ba3c0f643bf4a1dbe11c","amp;dn":"Dizzee+Rascal+-+Reading+%26+Leeds+Festival+2010++%5BDeZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6416bd45bd85b448c651ba3c0f643bf4a1dbe11c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,22,189,69,189,133,180,72,198,81,186,60,15,100,59,244,161,219,225,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
