Singers is a 50-person-strong voice choir comprised mostly of University of Florida and Santa Fe Community College students. Originally founded in 1970, the group is part of the University Methodist Church and Student Center (U.U.M.C.), Gainesville, FL. The group sings most Sundays at the U.U.M.C. worship service during the fall and spring semesters, and also tours often outside of the church. The Maranatha! Singers have also issued numerous recordings over the years, including 1999's Praise 16: Power of Your Love and Praise 17: In Your Presence, and are directed by Robert Jackson, plus accompanied by pianist James Gilbert, the latter of which issued his first solo piano release, Travels of the Heart, in 2001. ~ Greg Prato, All Music Guide ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4be67ee4e586900cdf2f6cc649f964f9ad82278","amp;dn":"Maranatha%21+Singers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4be67ee4e586900cdf2f6cc649f964f9ad82278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,190,103,238,78,88,105,0,205,242,246,204,100,159,150,79,154,216,34,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
