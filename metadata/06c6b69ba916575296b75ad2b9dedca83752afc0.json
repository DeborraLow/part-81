The Hottel memo, released through the FBI's new public online 'Vault,' was actually studied earlier by people such as Bruce Maccabee back in the 1970's when he obtained it through FOIA, Dolan noted. The description seems to relate more to the Aztec, NM 1948 UFO crash than the one that took place in Roswell, a year earlier, and the informant in the memo may have based his information on a Silas Newton lecture about the Aztec incident, given in 1950, said Dolan. More analysis of the Hottel memo is provided at AfterDisclosure.com. \n\nDolan pointed out that there have been other intriguing formerly classified documents that have surfaced such as a memo from December 1952 written by H. Marshall Chadwell of the CIA's Scientific Intelligence Dept. In it, he warned of UFOs &quot;that are not attributable to natural phenomena&quot; appearing near sensitive installations. \n\nDolan described an incident he recently heard about from a military witness to an event that occurred off the USS Saratoga in 1987 when it was stationed in the Bermuda Triangle. An aerial object approached the ship and jets were scrambled to intercept. One of the planes exploded, and after the UFO disappeared, a bearded man was seen on the ship walking through the bulkhead of the ship, like he was walking through a wall. Dolan also posited his theory that a &quot;breakaway civilization&quot; exists; a group in the classified/black budget world that's been able to employ clandestine and advanced technology in order to live off-world or underground. \n\nTax Alternatives\nIn the first hour, tax change advocates Tom Cryer and Bill Spillane discussed alternatives to the current tax system in the US. Spillane spoke on behalf of the FairTax, a national retail sales tax that would replace the payroll tax and other taxes, along with a rebate so that the poor won't be unfairly taxed. Cryer argued that there is no statute in the US tax code making people liable to pay, and thus the IRS is illegally collecting income tax from millions. He believes that if taxing ceased, we'd see an end to unemployment and a huge increase in local, state, and federal revenues. \n\nNew segment guest: Erik Fisher \n\nWebsite(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢keyholepublishing.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢afterdisclosure.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢fairtax.org\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢truthattack.org\nBook(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢A.D.
