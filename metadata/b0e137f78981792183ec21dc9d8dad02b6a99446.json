Burn or mount the iso file with poweriso (free download)\n2. choose license file and select the comsol-nodelocked40.dat file\n\nThat's it.\n\nI don't take credit for the license file. I got it from MACsimm torrent on demonoid.\nThis is the license file for 4.0 but it also work on 4.0a\n\nLast time I uploaded this torrent without the license file someone reported it as fake and almost got me banned from TPB.\nThis iso file is perfectly valid and virus free. I tested it on mac, windows 7 (32 bit) and fedora core without any trouble.\n\nThe only problem I noticed, is if you try to run comsol inside a 64 bits virtual machine running windows 7 64 bits. I got it working by launching the 32 bits exe.\n\nThis software has only few user so please seed as much as you can.\n\nenjoy the simulation\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e137f78981792183ec21dc9d8dad02b6a99446","amp;dn":"comsol+4.0a+%2B+license+file","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e137f78981792183ec21dc9d8dad02b6a99446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,225,55,247,137,129,121,33,131,236,33,220,157,141,173,2,182,169,148,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
