The Americans went even further, with a survey by the New York Philharmonic Society in 1935 showing his music to be more popular with their concert-goers than that of any other composer in the history of music - a degree of recognition in his own lifetime unequalled in Western music.\n\nThe words are provided almost entirely by Sibelius himself and his wife Aino and the music by Vladimir Ashkenazy, Elisabeth Soderstrom and Boris Belkin with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra.\n\nPart 1: The Early Years\nThe film offers an intimate account, using archive footage and Sibelius's music and words, of a great artist's struggle with his medium, with the world and with himself.\n\nPart 2: Maturity and Silence\nIn the second of two films exploring the life and music of Jean Sibelius, filmmaker Christopher Nupen covers the period from the fourth symphony to the unfinished eighth.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q9p2y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q9p2y&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 51 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 740 MB\nSubtitles: English\nSource: DVB-S\n\nProduced by Allegro Films for Channel 4\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86843018a33a7426f4558290168f1dc0255ddf2b","amp;dn":"BBC+Jean+Sibelius+PDTV+Xvid+AC3+Allegro+Films+1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86843018a33a7426f4558290168f1dc0255ddf2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,132,48,24,163,58,116,38,244,85,130,144,22,143,29,192,37,93,223,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
