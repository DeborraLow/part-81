She became a symbol of the Communist Revolution in Russia.\nDuring the First World War the ship operated in the Baltic Sea. At the end of 1916, the ship was moved to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) for a major repair. The city was brimming with revolutionary ferment and part of her crew joined the 1917 February Revolution. A revolutionary committee was created on the ship (Aleksandr Belyshev was elected its captain). Most of the crew joined the Bolsheviks, who were preparing for a Communist revolution.\nOn 25 October 1917, the refusal of an order for the Aurora to take to sea sparked the October Revolution. At 9.45 p.m. on that date, a blank shot from her forecastle gun signalled the start of the assault on the Winter Palace, which was to be the last episode of the October Revolution. Aurora's crew actually took part in the attack.\n\n\nThe film tells the story about a boy who learns about the history of the heroic cruiser Aurora  by visiting the museum ship, his friend, a composer, who writes a heroic song about the cruiser, and how the Aurora became the coolest battleship on the kids' playground. History lesson for young soviet citizens in the Brezhnev era.\n\nEnglish subtitles \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34255cc39f618f23be31870aaff5718bf1b72f33","amp;dn":"Aurora+%28Avrora%29+-+Roman+Kachanov+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34255cc39f618f23be31870aaff5718bf1b72f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,37,92,195,159,97,143,35,190,49,135,10,175,245,113,139,241,183,47,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
