The film takes place in the future, where Scotland has been quarantined due to the onset of a deadly virus. When the virus breaks out in London, political leaders send Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a cure based on evidence of survivors. Sinclair and her team run into two groups of survivors: marauders and medieval warriors. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on his vision of a futuristic soldier facing a medieval knight. In producing the film, he drew from various cinema, including Mad Max, Escape from New York, and other similar post-apocalyptic films.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf5f188a4eb7c3f1db3df81250786c4f165c220","amp;dn":"DOOMSDAY+%7B2008+-+Hindi+Dubbed%7D+BRRIP+mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf5f188a4eb7c3f1db3df81250786c4f165c220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,245,241,136,164,235,124,63,29,179,223,129,37,7,134,196,241,101,194,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
