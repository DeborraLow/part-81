They were formed in Ohio in 1976, when bassist Eric Moore got together with lead guitarist Mark Chatfield, rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Bob Hill, and drummer Glen Cataline. All four of them contributed lead vocals. The Godz signed with Casablanca in 1977, which was also the year in which they had an opening spot on Kiss\\' Love Gun Tour. They recorded two albums for Casablanca: 1978\\'s The Godz and 1979\\'s Nothing Is Sacred.\n\nThe Godz weren\\'t like their Casablanca labelmates Angel or Kiss as they were a straight ahead rock band, kind of like the local bar/biker band that made it to the big time.\n\nThis compilation was released by Black Rose Records (Germany) in 1997. The tracks consist of the entire first album, plus eight of the ten songs from Nothing Is Sacred. \\&quot;I Don\\'t Wanna Go Home\\&quot; isn\\'t listed on the CD but plays as the hidden 15th track.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970f3857223724ddea97db899ebac2b199907b03","amp;dn":"The+Godz+-+Power+Rock+From+USA+%281997%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970f3857223724ddea97db899ebac2b199907b03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,15,56,87,34,55,36,221,234,151,219,137,158,186,194,177,153,144,123,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
