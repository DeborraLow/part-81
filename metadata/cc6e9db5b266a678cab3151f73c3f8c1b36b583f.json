These are straight from the series, with the vocal audio accompanying.\n\nIt's not a perfect collection, but I hope you enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc6e9db5b266a678cab3151f73c3f8c1b36b583f","amp;dn":"From+The+Earth+To+The+Moon+-+A+Homemade+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc6e9db5b266a678cab3151f73c3f8c1b36b583f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,110,157,181,178,102,166,120,202,179,21,31,115,195,248,193,179,107,88,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
