NFO .............\n-The.Protector.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired 12.06.2011\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nLAPD Detective Gloria Sheppard (Ally Walker) \nand her partner Michelle (Tisha Campbell-\nMartin) investigate what looks to be a \nmugging gone wrong. But when Gloria uncovers \nevidence that links the victim to a psychic, \nit appears that it may have been a targeted \nmurder. At home, Gloria's life as a divorced \nmom, raising two boys with the help of her \nyounger brother Davey, has its own \nchallenges especially when her youngest son \nwants an elaborate homemade costume for his \nschool play. \n\nI guess some things just have to be spelled\nout. \n\nWe are pro-CRF when used well. [Sizing based\nbs is as outdated and pointless as xvid.]\n\nSettings do matter, especially those in the\nmotion estimation categories. Take a minute\nto read how they affect source analyzation.\n[O, yea, we never suggested any settings,\njust a ratefactor, and mocked the absurdity \nof using medium of course.]\n\nI'd think its obvious now, even to those\nwho did not get the jackalope comment, that\nspeed is a non-issue.\n\nEnjoy :)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cfda88af992cef28a40cb4bd5b0102c2707f0e5","amp;dn":"The.Protector.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cfda88af992cef28a40cb4bd5b0102c2707f0e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,253,168,138,249,146,206,242,138,64,203,75,213,176,16,44,39,7,240,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
