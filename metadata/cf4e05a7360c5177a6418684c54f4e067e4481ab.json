While the original Band of Joy was an experimental blues outfit that ran from 1966 to '68 and featured drummer John Bonham, Plant's new lineup ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ singer Patty Griffin, multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott, guitarist and co-producer Buddy Miller, drummer Marco Giovino and bassist Byron House ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have helped him make an album that recalls the intimate, moody vibe of his Grammy-winning collaboration with Alison Krauss, Raising Sand. Band of Joy  features covers of Townes Van Zandt's &quot;Harms Swift Way,&quot; the spiritual classic &quot;Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down&quot; and Los Lobos' &quot;Angel Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the groovy, rootsy first single.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4e05a7360c5177a6418684c54f4e067e4481ab","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Band+Of+Joy+%5Bmp3-160-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4e05a7360c5177a6418684c54f4e067e4481ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,78,5,167,54,12,81,119,166,65,134,132,197,79,78,6,126,68,129,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
