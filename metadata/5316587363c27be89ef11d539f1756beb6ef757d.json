Those of you who know him at all probably recognize him from his work in the Persona 3 &amp; Persona Trinity Soul soundtracks. Here's one of his albums for those of you who want to hear more of him, or who just want some J-rap. The songs on Only A Test are mostly in English with some Japanese mixed in. All songs are encoded in 256kbps mp3. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5316587363c27be89ef11d539f1756beb6ef757d","amp;dn":"%282006%29+Lotus+Juice+-+Only+A+Test","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5316587363c27be89ef11d539f1756beb6ef757d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,22,88,115,99,194,123,232,158,241,29,83,159,23,86,190,182,239,117,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
