It was the band's third appearance at the park, on a bill featuring fellow Harvest luminaries Roy Harper, Kevin Ayers, and headlined by Pink Floyd. Their 45 minute set is faithfully reproduced in all its raw and raucous glory!).\n\nMost retrospectives of the late 1960s and early 1970s musical counterculture tend to focus on the gentler side, the pastoral underground that kept the spirit of folk Eden alive. What still remains unfashionably overlooked is the scungier reaction to the hippy idyll: those artists whose refusal to smoke the peace pipe was expressed in a rawer, more desperate form of heavy blues-aftermath rock. Cast as willing outsiders from the start, the likes of Groundhogs, Pink Fairies, and Global Village Trucking Company were slated to play outside the fence, slamming and jamming protests and gurning crudities from the back of a flatbed truck. Mudflecked descendants of WinstanleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Diggers, arriving in clapped-out vans, to announce the wilting of flower power. Music from a paradise garden turned to mud. The most enduring of these were The Edgar Broughton Band, a righteous, Beefheart-loving brigade formed by Broughton brothers Robert (aka ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EdgarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) and Steve, with bassist Arthur Grant, in mid-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s Warwick. With in- again-out-again guitarist Victor Unitt, the outfit delivered a pounding to the Tolkien-tranquilised hordes of UFO and Middle Earth, taking up a strategic position in the Notting Hill scene in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢68, from where they were signed to Blackhill Enterprises and became an early addition to EMIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“alternativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ label, Harvest. This generation of the underground - which effectively lasted until the economic crises of the Heath administration, only to dissipate into the nationwide commune scene and the rugged ordeal of outdoor free festivals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fell into a curious blind spot in UK politics, with general rage against the Man and the Machine, but few specific issues to grapple with. How much more angry energy wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been generated had Britain stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the US in Vietnam? As this four-CD set - comprising five LPs plus an unreleased Hyde Park concert from 1970 - reveals, EBB had rage (and humour) in spades. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath Of An Electric CitizenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from debut Wasa Wasa, is a Beefheartian romp, as is single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œApache Drop OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a curious mix of Safe As Milk boogie and pastiche Shadows. And in channelling their hate into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOut Demons Out!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the ritual chant of the festival community, taped at a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“live studioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ concert at Abbey Road in December 1969, they found their vocation. Riffing off The FugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Pentagon-cleansing anthem, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDemonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is goof-off protest folk with a throbbing bluesy vein. Shortly after came the single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUp Yours!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a V-sign to the political process that todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s student dissenters would be wise to adopt. Sing Brother Sing (1970), full of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsongs about child molesters, nymphos and the imminent apocalypseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, according to one review, and The Edgar Broughton Band (1971) were the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s zenith. Concerts reveal EBB in their element, but surprise subtleties such as the string arrangements and stereo guitar effects on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor Dr SpockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and David BedfordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orchestrations on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvening Over RooftopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ show the group - now back with Unitt - to be more inventive in the studio than their scuzzy image might suggest. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ... RooftopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ aspires to epic status, a skyline meditation, uncannily pre-echoing Neil YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLike A HurricaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe BirthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is lanky and goosey-loose, gritted with hoarse harmonica. For Inside Out (1972), they decamped to a Devonshire mansion. Its remoteness from city life is audible in more laidback, country-ish textures, though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHomes Fit For HeroesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDouble AgentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ still dealt with contemporary issues. Oora (1973) keeps on trucking through triumphalist rock (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThings On My MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and austerity folk-rock (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvictionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½); the end of the Harvest story but not the band, who continue the mission to this day. In this new age of cuts, riots and harsh winters, their music might just start making sense.\n\nTracklist\nCD1\n1969 Wasa Wasa\nWasa Wasa is the debut album by progressive rock band, Edgar Broughton Band.

Led by the Broughton brothers, vocalist / guitarist Edgar and drummer Steve, and fleshed out by bassist Arthur Grant and guitarist Victor Unitt (who also briefly served with the Pretty Things), they soon signed with the Harvest label and issued their debut, Wasa Wasa, a collection of underground electric blues jams anchored by Edgar's Captain Beefheart-like vocals, in late 1969. The Edgar Broughton Band returned in 1970 with Sing Brother Sing, which reached the U.K. Top 20 and spawned a pair of minor hit singles, &quot;Out Demons Out&quot; and &quot;Apache Drop-Out&quot; (a fusion of Beefheart's &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; and the Shadows' &quot;Apache&quot;). The group seemed poised for a major commercial breakthrough, but even as their brand of heavy rock was flourishing thanks to groups like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, the Broughton Band made an about-face, and their music became considerably more quiet and politically charged. Their chart momentum stalled, and a 1971 self-titled effort failed to catch on. After both 1972's Inside Out and 1973's Oora met a similar fate, the group left Harvest for NEMS. Legal wrangles locked them out of the studio for a number of months, but they finally resurfaced in 1975 - minus Unitt, who'd been replaced by guitarist John Thomas - with Bandages. A brief breakup followed, but in 1978 they returned with Live Hits Harder. By the release of 1979's Parlez Vous English?, the group had expanded to a six-piece, using the name the Broughtons. Returning to the Edgar Broughton Band moniker, the band became a three-piece for 1982's Super Chip: The Final Silicon Solution, a concept album filled with synthesizers and new wave tempos. Touring continued throughout '80s, '90s, and 2000s. In 2004 the band's six albums for the Harvest label were reissued, each featuring numerous bonus tracks.\n\n1973 Oora\nside two\n01 Exhibits From A New Museum / Green Lights\n02 Face From A Window / Pretty / Hi-Jack Boogie / Slow Down\n03 Capers\nLive At Hyde Park, London 18th July 1970\n(previously unrleased)\n04 Love In The Rain\n05 Silver Needle\n06 Drop Out Boogie\n07 Refugee\n08 American Boy Soldier\n09 Out Demons Out \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4f1f6ffd76a1bb6156da5221a00f2fbde42aca1","amp;dn":"Edgar+Broughton+Band+-+The+Harvest+Years+1969-1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4f1f6ffd76a1bb6156da5221a00f2fbde42aca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,241,246,255,215,106,27,182,21,109,165,34,26,0,242,251,222,66,172,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
