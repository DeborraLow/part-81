If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d4eb5e7daf7846d2695e1f73fa165072cba4026","amp;dn":"Dvd-Cloner+VII+v7.60+build+998+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d4eb5e7daf7846d2695e1f73fa165072cba4026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,78,181,231,218,247,132,109,38,149,225,247,63,161,101,7,44,186,64,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
