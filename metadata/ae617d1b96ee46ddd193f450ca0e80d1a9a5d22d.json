After some discussion amongst the band members, Kansas decided on a compromise and went to work on their third album, Masque. Vocalist Steve Walsh contributed a few shorter, more accessible songs to the set, but Kerry Livgren's dark epics retained much of the style from the previous recording. The album is somewhat of a bridge between Song for America's heavier sound Leftoverture's more commercial direction. Although the collection contains some fan favorites such as &quot;Icarus - Borne on Wings of Steel,&quot; &quot;The Pinnacle,&quot; and &quot;All The World,&quot; the shorter songs failed to impress radio audiences. The opening track, &quot;It Takes a Woman's Love (to Make a Man)&quot;, was remixed for increased radio airplay, but failed to gain attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae617d1b96ee46ddd193f450ca0e80d1a9a5d22d","amp;dn":"Kansas+-+Masque+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae617d1b96ee46ddd193f450ca0e80d1a9a5d22d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,97,125,27,150,238,70,221,209,147,244,80,202,14,128,209,169,165,210,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
