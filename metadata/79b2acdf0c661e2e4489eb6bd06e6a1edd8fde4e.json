It automatically integrates with iTunes, iPhoto, and Aperture. You can share all content from these applications or choose specific playlists and albums.\nPlayback can also share media stored in folders or even make entire disks available to your Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. By default, Playback will share almost any content on your system. No configuration required! If you prefer to tinker, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll appreciate PlaybackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built-in access control list (ACL) and bandwidth throttling. The ACL allows you to control which devices have access to your media. Bandwidth throttling limits the transfer rate from your computer to your UPnP device so others on your network can still surf the web and check their email.\n\nOf course, if speed is your thing, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got that too. Playback was engineered for extreme speed. Your media is served via lighttpd (http://www.lighttpd.net/). This is the same software that powersWikipedia, and many other popular sites.\n\nOther features include Growl notifications, on-screen thumbnails powered by QuickLook, and much more!\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nVersion 1.6.2:\n* New: Support for MTS video files.\n* Fixed: Various Lightroom &amp; iTunes issues.\n* Fixed: Two crashes related to Spotlight.\n* Other: Improved threading &amp; responsiveness.\n\nMac Platform: UB Fully Cracked no serial needed.\nOS version: 10.5 and later\nLink for more information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://yazsoft.com/products/playback/information/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://yazsoft.com/products/playback/information/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b2acdf0c661e2e4489eb6bd06e6a1edd8fde4e","amp;dn":"Playback+1.6.2+%5BUB+k%5C%27d%5D.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b2acdf0c661e2e4489eb6bd06e6a1edd8fde4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,178,172,223,12,102,30,46,68,137,235,107,208,110,106,30,221,143,222,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
