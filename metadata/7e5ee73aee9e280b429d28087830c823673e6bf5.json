Billy Jump is an 80's rock star.             \n    Alexander Keaton is a corporate lackey with a cheating fiance. Vida     \n    is an evil mother in-law who torments Jean, her daughter in-law,         \n    incessantly. But Billy Jump is electrocuted by his guitar. Alexander     \n    has his head chopped off by a samurai. And Vida is mysteriously          \n    poisoned by tapioca pudding. Then the dead randomly start coming back    \n    to life. They don't eat brains, but they do want their old lives         \n    back. We follow the trials and tribulations of these three as they       \n    try to pick up where they left off, to mixed results. Billy Jump is      \n    trying to get his band back together for a big comeback, only to find    \n    that his old band members aren't quite the same people they used to      \n    be. Alexander wants his job back, but has been replaced by a             \n    computer, and his fiance has taken his house and is shacking up with    \n    another woman. Exhausted, he is taken in by a goth girl who has a        \n    thing for dead guys, and a vendetta against her father, Alex's former    \n    boss. Vida is determined to get rid of Jean once and for all, but        \n    finds that Jean is no longer the weak-willed pushover she once was.      \n    The rivalry between the two turns into an all out war once Roger,        \n    Vida's son, leaves for a business trip. The three stories are            \n    inter-cut together until we reach three action-packed pulse-pounding     \n    climaxes, which tie up loose ends with some surprising revelations.      \n                                                                             \n    Notes: Happy Belated birthday to our Favorite NAZI Sympathizer on        \n    this glorious April 20th!                                                \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
