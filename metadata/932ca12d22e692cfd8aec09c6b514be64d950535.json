With their addictive and vigourous riffs, Queens cut through in 2000 with their second album Rated R, featuring the propulsive Feel Good Hit of the Summer and The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret.\n\nTwo years later, the macho-rock recipe received an extra ingredient when Dave Grohl joined the band to record the smash follow up, Songs For The Deaf. Go With The Flow and the rollicking No One Knows became hits on MTV as well as radio worldwide, elevating the band to rock royalty. \n\nSince the departure of key members Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan, QOTSA has morphed somewhat, dabbling with acoustics and electronics on subsequent albums Lullabies to Paralyse and Era Vulgaris. The current lineup with Homme at the helm, assisted by Troy Van Leeuwen as axeman, Joey Castillo on drums, Dean Fertita on keys and guitar and Michael Shuman on bass will embark on a European tour to mark the 10th anniversary of the album, Rated R. The re-release features live tracks recorded at Reading and Leeds in 2000, so this show will be a chance for Homme and co. to recreate the magic that occurred a decade ago. Don't miss their full throttle performance on the Main Stage.\n\n*With no available info and at short notice, I am unable to provide the tracklisting for this set.Hopefully somebody else can post it and I'll add it to the description later.*\n\nSource: BBC iPlayer\nVideo Format: .FLV (Play with VLC or WMP Classic)\nAudio: 2ch stereo\nSize: 233MB\nLength: 39:56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932ca12d22e692cfd8aec09c6b514be64d950535","amp;dn":"Queens+Of+The+Stone+Age+-+Reading+%26+Leeds+Festival+2010++%5BDeZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932ca12d22e692cfd8aec09c6b514be64d950535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,44,161,45,34,230,146,207,216,174,192,156,107,81,75,230,77,149,5,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
