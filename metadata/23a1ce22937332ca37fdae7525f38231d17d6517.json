Not an easy one to get your hands on, but a BRILLIANT series (i give it an 8.5 out of 10 :D ).\n\n\n&quot;Filmed on South Australia's glorious River Murray, this television mini-series is set during the 1920s and tells of the story of a runaway who escapes to the river to work on a paddle-boat steamer and his friendship with an old salt captain played by Bill Kerr. Based on an original novel by Max Fatchen.&quot; (imdb).
