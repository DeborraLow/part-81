Perched at the edge of the airfield and built out of plywood and canvas held together with duct tape, the temporary building that houses the Role 3 shakes every time a plane takes off. The hospital's commander, Colonel Xavier Marks, tells the newcomers to expect an experience unlike any they've had before. Rebecca thinks she can handle anything, while Bobby is acutely conscious of his inexperience. They both get off to a rocky start, as Colonel Marks points out Rebecca's mistakes and tries to build Bobby's confidence. But over the next 48 hours, as they deal with rocket attacks, flying shrapnel and wave after wave of injured and wounded U.S. Marines, Canadian soldiers, Afghan civilians and even a Taliban prisoner, they manage to rise to the challenge, even as they grow more and more exhausted. Welcome to Kandahar, indeed.\n\nFile extension and size: .MKV ~ 1.09 GB\nAudio: Korean and Chinese ~ Subtitles: English and Dutch ~ Dutch custom by chillywitch (selectable)\nCategory: Series\nSource: HDTV\nMenu: No ~ Extras: No\nGenre: Drama\nWeblink: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1829891/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1829891/&lt;/a&gt;\nYouTube: \n\nVideo and audio information:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFormat            : Matroska at 3 699 Kbps\nLength            : 1.09 GiB for 42mn 19s 8ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 312 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7136e078f90e1ee46c54e6be41af9e2284f8c0da","amp;dn":"Combat+Hospital+S01E01+%28HDTV+DD5.1+ENG%2BNL+Subs%29+Hornigold+TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7136e078f90e1ee46c54e6be41af9e2284f8c0da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,54,224,120,249,14,30,228,108,84,230,190,65,175,158,34,132,248,192,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
