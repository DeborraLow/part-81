While another band called Skumbag featured Steve now of Taproot on drums and Mike now of Taproot on guitar, one day these bands played a gig together and both took interest in each others band. After a few conversations the 4 members dissolved their current bands and got together to form Taproot.\n\n**********Re-uploaded torrent cause I deleted old one and nobody ever seeded this. Will seed for 1 month until it takes, and if it don't, it'll be lost forever*************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25141bf53c382e0fa6b297b750727f31218f4814","amp;dn":"Taproot+Demos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25141bf53c382e0fa6b297b750727f31218f4814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,20,27,245,60,56,46,15,166,178,151,183,80,114,127,49,33,143,72,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
