(Two unaired episodes were broadcast for the first time on the Sci-Fi Channel in September 1997.) The original two-hour TV pilot was produced by Sam Raimi and developed by Sam Hamm. It starred actor Carl Lumbly. The show was unique, inasmuch as it depicted an African-American superhero.[citation needed]\n\nLumbly's character, Dr. Miles Hawkins, was a wealthy, mild-mannered doctor who was shot in the spine during a riot while helping a kid. He claimed by a cop and filed a lawsuit but lost the suit. He decided against appealing. Paralyzed from the waist down, he uses his company's resources to invent a powered exoskeleton that not only enables him to walk but gives him superhuman abilities. He utilizes a vast array of technology, including a large underwater lab and a hovercraft called the Crysalid to fly around the city. With his newfound power, he vows to fight crime and assumes the hidden identity of the vigilante &quot;M.A.N.T.I.S.&quot; (Mechanically Automated NeuroTransmitter Interactive System).\n\n\nvideo from WEBRips may be choppy  \n\nEnjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f546cee531a51b87dabf550e7f18e22c0313f47b","amp;dn":"MANTIS+TV+Series+Complete+%281994%29+WEBRips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f546cee531a51b87dabf550e7f18e22c0313f47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,70,206,229,49,165,27,135,218,191,85,14,127,24,226,44,3,19,244,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
