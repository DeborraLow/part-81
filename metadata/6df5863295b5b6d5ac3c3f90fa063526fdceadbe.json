Throughout his life, he confided his thoughts and emotions to his Notebooks, where we can still see his speculations and observations taking shape. This edition presents a selection from this unique work, newly presented, with notes and commentary, for the student as well as the general reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df5863295b5b6d5ac3c3f90fa063526fdceadbe","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2002%5D+Coleridge%5C%27s+Notebooks+A+Selection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df5863295b5b6d5ac3c3f90fa063526fdceadbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,245,134,50,149,181,182,213,172,60,63,144,250,6,53,38,253,206,173,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
