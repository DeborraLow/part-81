Give them creditÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not easy to take a stand when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re wearing 8-inch heels. They should survey all of the strippers in lower Manhattan. If thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anyone who is familiar with the concept of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpolls,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strippers.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some news for opponents of the centerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Muslim prayer services have been held since 2009 at the proposed community center site. The new part of the proposal is an Islamic community center with a swimming pool and gym. So are opponents really just opposed to Muslims getting into shape? OK Muslims, you can pray, but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do any crunches! Maybe opposition to the gym and the pool would be a clever move. There is a right to freedom of religion in the Constitution, but no specific right to work out. Yes, the Declaration of Independence does mention a right to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe pursuit of happiness,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but in my experience working out has nothing to do with happiness.\n\nWhy are 20-somethings taking so long to grow up? People in their 20ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are still searching for themselves. I can tell you where you can find yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the bathroom. At least thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where you are every time I need to use it. Anyway, for people who canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t commit, kids in their 20ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seem to have no problem committing to having some tramp-stamp tattooed on their upper butts for the rest of their lives. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m glad I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t commit to a tattoo in my early 20ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. I would have spent the past couple of decades explaining to people who the hell Night Ranger is.\n\nOn that note, a new study says that the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcougarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ phenomenon of older women hooking up with younger guys doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really exist. As soon as they heard that, a bunch of young guys thought ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreat. I just learned to dance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the HustleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for nothing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A researcher named Michael Dunn says he searched and was unable to find any evidence of cougars. My first question would be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow old is Michael Dunn?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ If heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is over 40, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wasting his time looking for cougars. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not coming out for him. If you want to find us, Michael Dunn, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go looking yourself. Send out Zac Efron.
