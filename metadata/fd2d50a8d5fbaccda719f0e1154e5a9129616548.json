As a Ford model, Little has appeared in campaigns for Estee Lauder, Nicole Miller, Murad and LeviÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.   She is also the face of Shade clothing.\n\n\nAt Shade, Little was introduced to photographer Angela Kohler. As a result, Kohler and production partner Ithyle Griffiths, both fans of Kindle and recent Kindle owners, invited Annie to collaborate with them for an Amazon Kindle video contest, which they proceeded to shoot in a single seven hour day in July 2009. In addition to starring in the commercial Little, the past recipient of a full scholarship for Vocal Performance at the University of Utah, co-wrote and recorded the song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFly Me AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Marcus Ashley to accompany the finished Amazon entry, which ultimately won both the Audience and the Amazon Jury prize.\n\n\nThe winning entry is currently airing on national television in addition to a subsequent Kindle commercial that features Annie on-screen as well as Little and AshleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStole My HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, available on their new EP along with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFly Me AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and two additional tracksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStill Missing YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTelegrams to MarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½exclusively on Amazon.  \n\n\n\nSilver Moons and paper chains,\nFaded maps and shiny things.\nYou're my favorite one-man show.\nA million different ways to go.\n\nWill you fly me away?\nTake me away with you,\nMy love.\n\nPainted scenes, I'm up all night.\nSlaying monsters, flying kites.\nSpeak to me in foreign tongues.\nShare your secrets one by one.\n\nWill you fly me away?\nTake me away with you,\nMy love.\n\nNow I cant think what life was like\nBefore I had you by my side.\nCant say what I'd do without you,\nKnowing what its like to have you.\n\nHidden walk ways back in time.\nEndless stories, lovers cry.\nIn my mind I've been set free.\nWill you take this Journey\nYou and Me?\n\nWill you Fly me away?\nTake me away with you,\nMy love.\n\nFly me away with you,\nMy Love.\n\nTake me away with you,\nMy Love.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2d50a8d5fbaccda719f0e1154e5a9129616548","amp;dn":"Annie+Little+-+Fly+Me+Away+%28Kindle+Commercial+Song%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2d50a8d5fbaccda719f0e1154e5a9129616548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,45,80,168,213,251,172,205,167,25,240,225,21,78,90,145,41,97,101,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
