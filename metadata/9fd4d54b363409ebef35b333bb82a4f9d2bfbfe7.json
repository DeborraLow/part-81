This is a more difficult album than his previous effort (the fine Salvation Blues), but at the same time more interesting and ultimately a superior work. \n\nOlson's use of flashing, effective imagery and out-of-the-mainstream arrangements lend the album a magical and peculiar quality that deserves a bit more attention than the insincere, thoughtless filler which plagues most indie music. \n\nHighly recommended and easily album of the year at this point. There's nothing out there as well executed from start to finish.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fd4d54b363409ebef35b333bb82a4f9d2bfbfe7","amp;dn":"Mark+Olson...Many+Colored+Kite%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fd4d54b363409ebef35b333bb82a4f9d2bfbfe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,212,213,75,54,52,9,235,239,53,179,51,187,130,164,249,210,191,191,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
