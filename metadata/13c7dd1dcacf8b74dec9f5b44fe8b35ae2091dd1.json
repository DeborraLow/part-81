Among the movie's awards are two Emmys and another three Emmy nominations. The movie was directed by David Lowell Rich.\n\nPLOT\n\nBased on the true story of the attempted defection in 1970 by a Lithuanian seaman seeking political asylum in the United States. Kudirka was denied asylum and returned to the Soviets, charged with treason, and sentenced to ten years of hard labor. It was later discovered and verified that his mother had been born in Brooklyn and gone to Lithuania at a young age, which meant she was a U. S. citizen. As a result, Kudirka was declared a U. S. citizen and in 1974 released by the Soviets.\n \nThe movie revolves around real-life Lithuanian seaman Simas Kudirka, a radio operator on a Soviet fish processing vessel. When his ship meets at sea with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter near Martha's Vineyard in early 1970, Kudirka makes a dramatic leap from the deck, landing on the USCGC Vigilant. He announces that he wishes to defect, but confusion over U.S. policy on defections prevent the Americans from offering him asylum. As the crew of the Vigilant looks on helplessly, Soviet officers are allowed to board the cutter, beat and bind Kudirka, and drag him back to his own ship. This tinderbox political incident occurs during a Soviet/U.S. conference over fishing rights. The ultimate fate of Simas Kudirka provides the core of the script.\n\nCAST\n\nAlan Arkin as Simas Kudirka \nRichard Jordan as Commander Edward Devon \nDonald Pleasence as Vladimir Popov \nGeorge Dzundza as Gruzauskas \nNicholas Guest as Baltrunar \nShirley Knight as Genna Kudirka \nJohn McMartin as Phillip Chadway \nTed Shackelford as Blain \n\nPRODUCTION\n\nThe movie was filmed in Portsmouth, NH, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and off the coast of New Hampshire and southern Maine.
