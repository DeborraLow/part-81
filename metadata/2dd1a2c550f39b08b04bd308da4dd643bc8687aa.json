Nobody seems to know exactly whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going on. The best guess now is that Pastor Jones will spend 9/11 standing over a pile of Qurans with a Zippo lighter in his hand. What happened? I think Pastor Terry Jones is a guy who is used to having followers who believe him, even if he says the sky is green. Now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standing in front of cameras saying the sky is green, and the real world isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t buying it. Well Pastor, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what happens when you try to expand your sphere of influence beyond 40 or 50 lunatics. There were a lot of twists in the story yesterday, which is what you expect dealing with someone as twisted as Terry Jones. He said they had a deal to cancel the Quran burning if the so-called Ground Zero mosque was moved. That boils down to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t attack you if you do as we say.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I think the technical term for that is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œextortion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Defense Secretary Robert Gates called Pastor Terry yesterday. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know exactly what Robert Gates said to him, and I suspect that Pastor Terry doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t either. Pastor Terry probably thinks Robert Gates offered to move the Pentagon to another location because it has a mosque inside of it. Now Pastor Terry says he is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrethinkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Quran burning. Re-thinking? This episode shows precious little evidence of any thinking in the first place. This is the most drawn out, agonized, absurd decision since Brett FavreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last retirement.\n\nBy the way, what is up with Pastor TerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s absurd facial hair? I know you live in the 19th century, Pastor, but you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to look like it. At least get a monocle and a walking stick to complete the look. Pastor Terry looks like Chester A. Arthur. Not a lot of people know who that is. And if the world was rational, we could say the same thing about Pastor Terry.\n\nOn a lighter note, check out this comically impassioned speech from a guy named Phil Davison trying to be selected (he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t) as the GOP nominee for Treasurer of Stark County, Ohio (video below). Phil looks like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at wrestling smack down. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m glad his opponent wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Phil might have hit him with a folding chair. I would wish Phil success in his future career, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m afraid of how worked up he would get if he ever ran for something beyond Stark County Treasurer.
