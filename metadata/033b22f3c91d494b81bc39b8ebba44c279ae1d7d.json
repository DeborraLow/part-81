During a brief jail stay, two half-brothers, who have rarely seen each other while growing up, connect. One of them, called 20/20 Mike because he can sense people nearby, concocts a scheme in which the two of them will steal some dope from young couriers. The heist goes awry when Billy, the junkie brother, shoots the victims of the theft. The brothers hole up in an abandoned building, and 20/20 Mike seeks help from an old cell mate, Tony, whom he thinks is out of the life. It turns out that they have stolen Tony\\'s dope, and Tony\\'s boss wants the two thieves dead. Is there any way out?\n\nDVDR 16 PAL\n4.01GB\nEnglish(US) audio\nOnly Bulgarian Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033b22f3c91d494b81bc39b8ebba44c279ae1d7d","amp;dn":"Once+in+the+Life+DVDR+Kc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033b22f3c91d494b81bc39b8ebba44c279ae1d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,59,34,243,201,29,73,75,129,188,57,184,235,186,68,194,121,174,29,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
