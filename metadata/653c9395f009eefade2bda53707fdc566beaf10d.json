Motosuwa Hideki is a poor student who failed his entrance exams to get into college. So, Hideki is forced to move to the city, get a job, and attend cram school in hopes of passing the next college entrance exam. He of course wants a Persocom for himself, but is way too poor to afford one. One day, while passing a building, he finds a Persocom in a trash heap. However, his new find doesn't seem to be like the others he's heard about. She doesn't seem to have any operating system at all, and only says &quot;Chii&quot;. As Hideki learns more about his Persocom (aptly named &quot;Chii&quot;), he finds out that she is not of any known type, and most likely some sort of homemade model. He also learns of the rumor of the &quot;Chobits&quot;, Persocoms with the ability to think for themselves, instead of running only complex programs. Find out what happens between Hideki and his new Persocom, as she learns more about her environment, people, and life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:653c9395f009eefade2bda53707fdc566beaf10d","amp;dn":"Chobits+Manga+Vol+1+-+8+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"653c9395f009eefade2bda53707fdc566beaf10d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,60,147,149,240,9,238,250,222,43,218,83,112,127,220,86,107,234,241,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
