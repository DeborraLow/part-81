Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each folder one by one.\n\nA few bugs was fixed, but most important now it wont eat too much memory. I found out that if using the application with alot (34.000+) images, then it would eat all memory - I also fixed another memory problem which popped up if the image was in a bad .jpg format.\n\nI removed the picture box that showed the last moved/copied image.\nInstead I show the number of files moved/copied, total images processed, average width and height of processed images. Using the average info you have a more clear picture of what sizes you might want to consider to move/copy.\n\n\nRequirements: .NET 3.5 and additional V2.0 .NET framework\n\n- (C) 2011 114 Dasma Software, Philippines\nApplications Games SEO &lt;a href=&quot; http://114-software.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://114-software.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f82835d9a472b17c02d7348d9cff76a19029f60","amp;dn":"Batch+Move+Copy+Images+V2.2b16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f82835d9a472b17c02d7348d9cff76a19029f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,130,131,93,154,71,43,23,192,45,115,72,217,207,247,106,25,2,159,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
