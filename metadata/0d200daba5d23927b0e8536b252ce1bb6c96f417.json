He says that he values art, culture and media above all else. He is a dedicated professional musician with lofty goals and big dreams.\n\nBigga loves Top Ramen. He has stated that he lives like a university student, constantly eating soup and writing a new song everyday.\n\n&quot;I don't want kids, and I hope I never have them. I want to leave a gift to the world.. My music.. not just another piece of human bio trash like most people turn out to be.&quot; -J Bigga\n\nBigga has turned down offers from two major record lables. &quot;I can't believe the offers I've gotten from these labels&quot; Says J, &quot;Now I realize why these bands are on MTV. It's not because they sound good, It's because they were stupid enough to sign!&quot;\n\n\n\nI bought this album and wanted to share it with TPB, so all I ask is you seed and possibly look into his music.
