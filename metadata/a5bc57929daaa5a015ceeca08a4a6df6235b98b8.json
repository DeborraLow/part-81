The shader variables can be modified using sliders, color pickers, or text entry depending on the variable's type. Changes can then be exported along with any model and textures you have selected to be used in DarkBASIC Professional and Dark GDK.\n\nHope it works guys!:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5bc57929daaa5a015ceeca08a4a6df6235b98b8","amp;dn":"Dark+Shader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5bc57929daaa5a015ceeca08a4a6df6235b98b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,188,87,146,157,170,165,160,21,206,236,160,138,74,109,246,35,91,152,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
