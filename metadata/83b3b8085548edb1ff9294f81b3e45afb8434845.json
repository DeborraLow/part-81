When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b3b8085548edb1ff9294f81b3e45afb8434845","amp;dn":"The+Expendables+2010+Cam+Xvid+-+CLASSiFiED.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b3b8085548edb1ff9294f81b3e45afb8434845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,179,184,8,85,72,237,177,255,146,148,248,27,62,69,175,184,67,72,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
