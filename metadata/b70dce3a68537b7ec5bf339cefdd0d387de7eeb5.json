He later admitted it was a publicity stunt.\n\nOther than those rumours, Chad Beloin\\\\\\'s entire career is 100% true, about his Deep Into The Nation Tour, I know it\\\\\\'s happening because I\\\\\\'ve got tickets to the first show, plus I\\\\\\'ll definitely be watching the Livestream performance. I hope he finds this, cause if he does, Chad, please don\\\\\\'t delete this... it\\\\\\'s going to do you a HUGE favor, as well as, could you please do a few rehearsals on Livestream? I\\\\\\'d love to watch!\n\nABOUT THE TORRENT:\n\nThis torrent includes Chad Beloin\\\\\\'s albums \\\\\\&quot;Home Free: Deluxe Edition\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Deep Into The Life of Chad Beloin Part One\\\\\\&quot;.
