Again, if it doesn't, all I can suggest is going to demonoid.\n\nPLEASE HELP SEED: I'm on a small PC that gets tracked by my server and these files need to be UP on the web SOMEwhere.  CPAP machines remain under FDA shackles and doctor shackles, when in fact anyone who owns one should be able to see the data themselves when they want to of their own sleep apnea patterns!  Resmed and Respironics and Puritan Bennett all make people pay 200 bucks or more for software just so they can see the data that's already on their CPAP machines!  It is BULLSHIT.  Further, they don't even allow home users to adjust their machines, hiding the controls so they HAVE to go into their doctors for adjustments. NO MORE.  Included are the Rescan 3.10 software for ResMed CPAP machines, Silverlining 3.0 for Puritan Bennett and Encore Pro 2.2 for Respironics machines.  Also included are the CLINICIAN manuals for these machines, enabling anyone to adjust their own machine.  PLEASE HELP KEEP THIS ON THE WEB even if you don't have sleep apnea (yet).  Trust me, by age 50, most of us will have it, and we need to look out for each other.  I can't keep seeding due to being a measly little one person. Thanks to all for this.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54f982fba6126de236dbc3916e0587cbe78ae65","amp;dn":"CPAP+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54f982fba6126de236dbc3916e0587cbe78ae65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,79,152,47,186,97,38,222,35,109,188,57,22,224,88,124,190,120,174,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
