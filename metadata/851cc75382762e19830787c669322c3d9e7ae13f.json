Empty Sky is quite indicative of the post-Sgt. Pepper's era. With its ambitious arrangements and lyrics, it's clear that John and Taupin intended the album to be a major statement. Though it shows some signs of John's R&amp;B roots, most of the album alternates between vaguely psychedelic rock and burgeoning pop songcraft, capped off by a bizarre reprise of brief moments of all of the songs on the record. There aren't any forgotten gems on Empty Sky, but it does suggest John's potential.\n\n\nSeed and enjoy all!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:851cc75382762e19830787c669322c3d9e7ae13f","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Empty+Sky+%281969+Album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"851cc75382762e19830787c669322c3d9e7ae13f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,28,199,83,130,118,46,25,131,7,135,198,105,50,44,61,158,122,225,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
