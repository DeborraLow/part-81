Arguing that evolved characters of organisms such as morphology, behavior and life history influence their ecological relationships, this new conceptual framework is broadly relevant to ecologists, evolutionary biologists, behavioral scientists and entomologists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbee75dafd0dee610ce0ca30f1694b0369b41394","amp;dn":"Macroevolutionary+Theory+on+Macroecological+Patterns+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbee75dafd0dee610ce0ca30f1694b0369b41394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,238,117,218,253,13,238,97,12,224,202,48,241,105,75,3,105,180,19,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
