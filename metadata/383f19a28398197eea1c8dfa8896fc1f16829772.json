Years earlier, Castor, in an attempt to kill Archer, accidentally killed Archer's young son, Michael; the two have been obsessed with each other ever since. The FBI receives information that Castor's brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), has chartered a plane at LAX airport. Archer knows that Pollux will not fly without Castor, so he leads a joint FBI/LAPD team to chase the plane down, which crashes into a hangar. In the ensuing chaos, Pollux is captured by the FBI and Castor is knocked into a coma after bragging to Archer about a bomb that will destroy Los Angeles. Archer's work colleagues congratulate him on catching Castor, but Archer rebuffs the praise he is given and says it should go to those who died attempting to arrest Castor.Although he learns the date of the bombing, Archer is unable to find any information about the location of the bomb itself. Knowing that the only way to obtain the location is from Pollux; and the only person Pollux will reveal the location to is Castor, Archer's colleagues present him with a top-secret mission: he will undergo an experimental surgical procedure to temporarily graft Castor's face onto his skull, infiltrate the prison where Pollux is being held, and get the location of the bomb. Arrangements are made for Archer (as Castor) to be incarcerated with Pollux in prison.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease date: 7 November 1997 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nJohn Travolta as Sean Archer/Castor Troy\nNicolas Cage as Castor Troy/Sean Archer\nJoan Allen as Dr. Eve Archer\nAlessandro Nivola as Pollux Troy\nGina Gershon as Sasha Hassler\nDominique Swain as Jamie Archer\nNick Cassavetes as Dietrich Hassler\nHarve Presnell as Victor Lazarro\nColm Feore as Dr. Malcolm Walsh\nC.
