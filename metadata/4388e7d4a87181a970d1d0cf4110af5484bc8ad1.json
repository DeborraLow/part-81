(^_^)\n\nThis comes on Showtime. It has the girl for Precious.\n\nTagline - Time to grab life by the balls. \n\nShow Nfo - A suburban mom, diagnosed with cancer, tries to find the humor in the disease. \n\nReview - I'm giving it 7 because from the pilot it has a lot of potential, and hopefully will mature nicely. Some bits were very very funny, some bits tried hard but weren't funny.\n\nThe son and husbands characters need to be refined because they were not quite there, but Laura Linney was very good and plays the lead role well. The the emotion and reactions seemed believable, i hope that it doesn't try and jam morals down the viewers throat (eg. scrubs) because it is clever enough to do more than that.\n\nI'm going to watch the next one with interest and hope it goes up to a 9/10. \n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY!\n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
