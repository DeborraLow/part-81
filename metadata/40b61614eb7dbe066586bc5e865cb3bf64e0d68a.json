Despite receiving rave reviews, the band's eponymous album failed to elevate them to the premier league, largely due to RCA's bizarre decision not to release it until the summer of 1968 - a full year after it had been completed. \n\nNot that such record company procrastination matters now, as the album has long been regarded as one of the most dazzling examples of the British psychedelic pop genre. It forms the basis of this new, definitive Skip Bifferty collection, which, for the first time, gathers their entire studio output under one roof. \n\nPride of place goes to three previously unreleased recordings, all taken from the original master-tapes. `Jesus Smith (The Other Side Of)' is the band's semi-legendary, hitherto-lost debut studio recording, while there are two versions of `Skizoid Revolution', a song that has previously only been available with a guest vocal from Alan Hull. As with all Skip Bifferty material, these far superior versions feature the soulful tones of the band's lead singer, the hugely underrated Graham Bell. \n\nAn essential release for anyone interested in British psychedelia!\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b61614eb7dbe066586bc5e865cb3bf64e0d68a","amp;dn":"Skip+Bifferty...Skip+Bifferty%281968%29cd2010%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b61614eb7dbe066586bc5e865cb3bf64e0d68a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,182,22,20,235,125,190,6,101,134,188,94,134,92,179,191,100,224,214,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
