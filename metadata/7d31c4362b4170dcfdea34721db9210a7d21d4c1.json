THE UNSEEN has been withheld from DVD by MCA,  who has owned the rights since 1958.   This copy,  taken from a DVD of a 1970\\'s U-matic copy of a 1958 TV release print,  has been re-mastered to restore as much as possible of the original contrast ratio and the Oscar-nominated sound.   To be fair,  it is now only watchable.  The versions being sold on eBay are not.\n\nComplete and ready to burn to single-layer DVD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d31c4362b4170dcfdea34721db9210a7d21d4c1","amp;dn":"The+Unseen++1945+Gail+Russell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d31c4362b4170dcfdea34721db9210a7d21d4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,49,196,54,43,65,112,220,253,234,52,114,29,185,33,10,125,33,212,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
