Molly Meldrum was crowned King.[5]\n\nCeberano is a member of the Church of Scientology, after being brought up as a practicing member since childhood. Ceberano believes public hostility towards the church is linked to &quot;people with vested interests everywhere. We have in the division of the church some very strong viewpoints as regards to psychiatry. I mean, we quite blatantly believe psychiatry kills. And I think it does ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it kills the mind and kills self-determinism and kills the right for a person to be an identity,&quot; despite the fact that Scientology has consistently been linked to intimidation, fraud, burglary, smear campaigns and character assassination since it's inception.[6][7]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d961d47ab9a9a326183212c1755b6e8a1b4a347","amp;dn":"Kate+Ceberano+-+6+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d961d47ab9a9a326183212c1755b6e8a1b4a347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,150,29,71,171,154,154,50,97,131,33,44,23,85,182,232,161,180,163,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
