Heavily indebted to the contemplative quiet of Zen teachings, Berry works with sound from the inside out, moulding delicate fragments of sound into timbrally radiant swells that tumble in and out of silence through evolving patterns and repetitions. The thoroughly compelling A Strange Feather emerges as a snowdrift kaleidoscope in cold greys, wet greens and luminous whites. Within these elegant swells of wintry sound, gestural events punctuate Berry's blurred orchestration with down-pitched tactile bristlings and delicate electric vibrations. With the possible exception of Thomas KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ner and William Basinski at their very best, no one else gets close to the overwhelming beauty and sombre tranquillity of Keith Berry's work.'\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://museumofimaginaryhistories.blogspot.com/2008/01/keith-berry-strange-feather.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://museumofimaginaryhistories.blogspot.com/2008/01/keith-berry-strange-feather.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAAC (neroAacEnc)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498b9e9e1ce306c258b2285376d8620e6bec7c0d","amp;dn":"Keith+Berry-A+Strange+Feather","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498b9e9e1ce306c258b2285376d8620e6bec7c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,139,158,158,28,227,6,194,88,178,40,83,118,216,98,14,107,236,124,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
