The book, which was prepared jointly with the European Space Science Committee (under the aegis of the European Science Foundation) begins with a broad survey of the historical and political context of U.S.-Europe cooperation and collaboration in space.\n\nThe focus of the book is a set of 13 U.S.-Europe missions in astrophysics, space physics, planetary sciences, earth sciences, and life and microgravity research that illustrate &quot;lessons learned&quot; on the evolution of the cooperation, mission planning and scheduling, international agreements, cost-sharing, management, and scientific output.\nThese lessons form the basis of the joint committee's findings and recommendations, which serve to improve the future conduct and enhance the scientific output of U.S.-Europe cooperation and collaboration in space science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d19ac452bd849448ca25a7ab8b2e4e8f1dc207","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1998%5D+U.S.-Europe+Collaboration+in+Space+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d19ac452bd849448ca25a7ab8b2e4e8f1dc207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,209,154,196,82,189,132,148,72,202,37,167,171,139,46,78,143,29,194,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
