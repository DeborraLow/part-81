Shake Me Like A Dog\n\nDocument's series of &quot;complete recorded works in chronological order&quot; has resulted not only in all of the performances being reissued of major pre-war blues performers, but the work of quite a few minor personalities too. Ed Bell, a singer/guitarist from Atlanta, lived until 1966 but made all of his recordings during 1927 and 1929-1930. One of his best sessions was cut one day in September 1927, a solo date resulting in four memorable lowdown blues.\n\nOtherwise, Bell is heard as &quot;Sluefoot Joe,&quot; &quot;Barefoot Bill From Alabama,&quot; and on two vocal-guitar duets with Pillie Bolling. In addition, this CD has Bolling's only other recordings, two solo numbers from 1930. A collector's item of its kind, this disc will be enjoyed by fans of early country blues. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc5ce4ccfe6f532535808bfa965c84de8d0d87fd","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Ed+Bell+-+Mamlish+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc5ce4ccfe6f532535808bfa965c84de8d0d87fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,92,228,204,254,111,83,37,53,128,139,250,150,92,132,222,141,13,135,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
