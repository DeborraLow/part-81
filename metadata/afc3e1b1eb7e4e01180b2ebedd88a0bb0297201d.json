Also, Cahit Berkay, who was a member of SelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§uk AlagÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶z Band, and Haluk Kunt, who was a member of VahÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸i Kediler (Wild Cats), both joined the band.\nLater, Haluk Kunt was replaced by Hasan Sel, who was a member of ApaÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸lar (Apachies) in 1968, and Ayd?n Daruga was replaced by Engin YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ko?lu in 1969.\nIn 1970, Hasan Sel was replaced by Taner ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r, previously a member of Meteorlar (Meteors) and the Erkin Koray Quartet.\nThe band tried to fuse the technical aspects of pop music with the melodies of Anatolian folk music in late 1960s and early 1970s\nIn July 1970, Aziz Azmet, the band\\'s vocalist left the band and Ersen Dinleten replaced him for a short time.\nMo?ollar recorded Ternek/HaliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§\\'te GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n Bat?Ãƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸? (Ternek/Sunset on the Golden Horn) 45 rpm, and left for Paris in August 1970.\nThe group won the Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy (previously won by such groups as Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix) in 1971.\nNearly all of the tracks on this album are compositions or traditional arrangements of Murat Ses, the group\\'s keyboardist, arranger and composer. This ambum is compelling work from the Turkish scene of the early 70s -- music that fuses rock and folk roots, and which makes heavy use of the Turkish baglama -- an instrument with strong sitar-like qualities.\nMost of the tunes here are instrumentals that lay the baglama solos out over heavier rhythms -- in a driving sound that\\'s certainly got roots in folk, but which comes off with more of a rock-like intensity.\nThere\\'s a bit of fuzz on some of the instrumentation, but we can\\'t tell for sure how much electricity was used by the band -- and although the English language notes on the CD do a great job of laying out the group\\'s history and recordings, we wish they\\'d give a bit more specifics on that front!\nCD features a fair number of bonus tracks, including key recordings done by Mogollar in Paris -- and titles include \\&quot;Ozum Kaldi\\&quot;, \\&quot;Misket\\&quot;, \\&quot;Behind The Dark\\&quot;, \\&quot;Hicaz Mandira\\&quot;, \\&quot;Yine Bir Gulnihal\\&quot;, \\&quot;Senhaz Longa\\&quot;, \\&quot;Hitchin\\&quot;, \\&quot;Dag Ve Cocuk\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Garip\\&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc3e1b1eb7e4e01180b2ebedd88a0bb0297201d","amp;dn":"Mogollar+-+Mogollar+%281971%2F2004%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc3e1b1eb7e4e01180b2ebedd88a0bb0297201d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,195,225,177,235,126,78,1,24,11,46,190,221,136,160,187,2,151,32,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
