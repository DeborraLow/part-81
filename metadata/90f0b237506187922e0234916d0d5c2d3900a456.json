Kit was born in the Skull Cave, and spent his first years in the jungle of Bengalla. His mother, Maud Thorne McPatrick, who had previously worked as Rita Hayworth's stunt double, was born in Mississippi, where Kit went to study when he was 12 years old, living with his aunt Lucy and uncle Jasper in the fictional town of Clarksville.\n\nHere he met his wife-to-be, Diana Palmer. Kit was an extremely talented sportsman and was predicted to become the world champion of many different events (even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring match when the champion visited Clarksville). Despite the opportunity to choose practically any career he wanted, Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla to take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his father was dying from a knife-wound.[30]\n\nOne of Kit's first missions as the Phantom was to find his father's killer, Rama Singh, who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping him to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood, only to then stab him in the back, stealing his special gunbelt in the process. The 21st Phantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique, but before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail, the desperate Rama blew up his lair, killing himself and his henchmen in the process.[31]\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 24mn\nBit rate : 1 746 Kbps\nWidth : 656 pixels\nHeight : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.289\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 24mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 103 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\n\n\nIMDB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438437/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438437/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83301554871693359189.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83301554871693359189.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f0b237506187922e0234916d0d5c2d3900a456","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+%282009%29+DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+%7B1337x%7D-X.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f0b237506187922e0234916d0d5c2d3900a456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,240,178,55,80,97,135,146,46,2,52,145,109,13,92,45,57,0,164,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
