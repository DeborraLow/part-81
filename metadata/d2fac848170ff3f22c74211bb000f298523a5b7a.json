These villages are under constant threat of earthquakes, so select villagers called diggers are relegated to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger who is ostracized by his peers, finds solace in his best friend and older brother figure, an eccentric delinquent named Kamina, who allows Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fac848170ff3f22c74211bb000f298523a5b7a","amp;dn":"Tengen+Toppa+Gurren+Lagann+Manga+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fac848170ff3f22c74211bb000f298523a5b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,250,200,72,23,15,243,242,44,116,33,27,176,0,242,152,82,58,91,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
