Islamic Community Center, a Roundtable Discussion With Mother of 9/11 Victim, Rabbi, Muslim Lawmaker and Islamic Scholar\n\nWe spend the hour on the controversy around the proposed construction of an Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan, which has turned into a national issue. Opposition to the center first started among fringe, right-wing blogs but has swept into the mainstream, with some Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid coming out against it. Republicans have vowed to make the controversy a campaign issue in the Fall. We host a roundtable with four guests: Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress; Rabbi Irwin Kula of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; Islamic scholar John Esposito of Georgetown University; and Talat Hamdani, whose son Salman died on 9/11 in the attacks on the World Trade Center.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b2c8a4cc69ac03b7d1c95d8da10c1b2afe3ab32","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+18+aug+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b2c8a4cc69ac03b7d1c95d8da10c1b2afe3ab32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,44,138,76,198,154,192,59,125,28,149,216,218,16,193,178,175,227,171,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
