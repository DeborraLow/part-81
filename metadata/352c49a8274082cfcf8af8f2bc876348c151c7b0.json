The song was released in North America as his debut single from his debut album there, All or Nothing. In other markets, including the UK, the song serves as Jay Sean's lead single from his third studio album. The single features American rapper and label mate Lil Wayne and is produced by J remy and Bobby Bass. &quot;Down&quot; is the seventh-best selling single of 2009, having sold more than three million digital copies in the United States alone, and has been certified Platinum in several countries.[2] The song has sold six million copies worldwide, and also received a large airplay of two billion listener impressions on radio worldwide.\n\nThe track was released to US radio on 31 May 2009, and digital retailers on 30 June 2009. &quot;Down&quot; hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the issue dated 17 October 2009, knocking The Black Eyed Peas off the top of the chart after their 26 week reign at number one. This made Jay Sean the first British act to score a Billboard Hot 100 number-one single since Coldplay's &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; in 2008, and the fourth British act overall this decade. The song has also made him the first UK Urban act ever to top Billboard's Hot 100, the ninth (second British) male solo performer to top the US charts with his debut single in the US, and the first British act to have reached #1 in the US and not in the UK with a song since Seal's Kiss From A Rose in 1995. It is also the best-selling single by a British/European male artist in North America since Elton John's &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; in 1997, and the first by an British Asian artist since Freddie Mercury in 1980.\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4109282629010d756f71&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 3mn 41s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 6 787 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 25.0 Mbps\nWidth                            : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.131\nStream size                      : 176 MiB (93%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 105 r1732 2b04482\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 3mn 41s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 10.2 MiB (5%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352c49a8274082cfcf8af8f2bc876348c151c7b0","amp;dn":"Jay+Sean+Ft.+Lil+Wayne+-+Down+%5BMTV+HD%5D+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352c49a8274082cfcf8af8f2bc876348c151c7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,44,73,168,39,64,130,207,207,138,248,242,188,135,99,72,193,81,199,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
