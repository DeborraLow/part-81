It stars Ellen Burstyn, Sam Shepard, Richard Farnsworth, Roberts Blossom and Eva LeGallienne.\n\n Ellen Burstyn ...  Edna Mae McCauley \n Sam Shepard ...  Cal Carpenter \n Richard Farnsworth ...

Hank Peterson \n\n\nThe movie was written by Lewis John Carlino and directed by Daniel Petrie.\n\nOne of the hidden themes of Resurrection is that stardom can change the entourage to a greater extent than the principal herself. Grandma and Grandpa are pretty much the same, respectively understanding and taciturn, but the boyfriend changes completely, and the townsfolk soon regard Burstyn as a novel form of entertainment. Can she heal this person? What's next? \n\nBurstyn's changes are at first physical: she can walk, at first with a cane, then without. She also develops a knack for public speaking, which seems expected of her since miracles and ministry are intermingled in the minds of the conservative, religious farm families. But her gentle and informal pronoucements are insufficiently zealous to please the fundamentalists, which eventually force her to flee the curious, the demented, and the scientists by living undercover at a gas station in the middle of nowhere.\n\nIt was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Ellen Burstyn) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Eva LeGallienne).\n\nAcademy Awards, USA \n \n1981  Nominated Oscar Best Actress in a Leading Role Ellen Burstyn \n1981  Nominated Oscar Best Actress in a Supporting Role Eva Le Gallienne \n \nAcademy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA \n\n1981  Nominated Saturn Award Best Actress Ellen Burstyn \n1981  Nominated Saturn Award Best Music Maurice Jarre \n1981  Nominated Saturn Award Best Supporting Actress Eva Le Gallienne \n1981  Nominated Saturn Award Best Writing Lewis John Carlino  \n\nAvoriaz Fantastic Film Festival \n \n1981  Won Special Jury Award Daniel Petrie \n \nGolden Globes, USA \n \n1981  Nominated Golden Globe Best Motion Picture Actress - Drama Ellen Burstyn  \n\nNational Board of Review, USA \n \n1980  Won NBR Award Best Supporting Actress Eva Le Gallienne  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c686beba9fba6df156b44f6a14a6387e225ec76","amp;dn":"Resurrection+%28VHS%29+%5B1980%5D+Ellen+Burstyn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c686beba9fba6df156b44f6a14a6387e225ec76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,104,107,235,169,251,166,223,21,107,68,246,161,74,99,135,226,37,236,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
