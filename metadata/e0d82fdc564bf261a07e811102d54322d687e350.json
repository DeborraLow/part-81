It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties. To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - &quot;it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!&quot; Greg insists, preferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. &quot;One day when I'm famous,&quot; writes Greg, &quot;I'll have better things to do than answer peoples' stupid questions all day.&quot; So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary.\n\nVideo Specifications:\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1518 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 1280x688\nAspect Ratio: 1.860\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.072\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy1a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy1a.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy1b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy1b.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRelease Title: Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2 2011 720p BRRip\n\nMovie Info:\nIMDB: www.imdb.com/title/tt1650043/\nSize Of Mp4: 1.50 GB (1,613,651,775 bytes)\nSource: WiKi\nBlu-Ray Release Date: 25th March 2011\nCertification: Rated PG for some mild rude humor and mischief\nGenre: Comedy\nFilm Length: 1:39:33\nLanguage: English\nStoryine: Back in middle school after summer vacation, Greg Heffley and his older brother Rodrick must deal with their parents' misguided attempts to have them bond.\n\nVideo Specifications:\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1732 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 1280x544\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.104\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy2a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy2a.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy2b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.release-lounge.com/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/wimpy2b.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAudio Specifications:\nFormat: AAC-LC\nBitrate:AAC-LC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps\nBitrate Mode: Adaptive\nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 (Stereo) / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels (3/2 .1)\nSample Rate: 48000Hz [Both]\nSubtitles: NONE\nSample: NONE\n\nCompatiblilty: PS3, Popcorn Hour, WD &amp; XBOX 360\nThe MP4 contains 2 audio channels, 6 Channel and 2 Channel.
