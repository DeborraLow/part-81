It uses poet Brian Hookers 1923 English blank verse translation as the basis for its screenplay. The film was the first motion picture version in English of Rostands play, though there were several earlier adaptations in different languages.\n\nThe 1950 film was produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by Michael Gordon. JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ferrer received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring performance as Cyrano de Bergerac. Mala Powers played Roxane, and William Prince portrayed Christian de Neuvillette.\n\n JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ferrer ...  Cyrano de Bergerac \n Mala Powers ...  Roxane \n William Prince ...

Since it first saw the light of night on a Parisian stage in 1897, it never goes long unperformed in some form or other. Kevin Kline and Jennifer Garner are reviving Edmond RostandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plumed, caped evergreen on Broadway. In Michigan, a new operatic version by David Di Chiera is being unveiled. Nor has it been ignored on film. Christian Coquelin, who originated the role, recorded a soliloquy in one of the first attempts at recorded sound on film. Gerard Depardieu starred in a 1990 version resplendent with idiomatic rightness and FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collective affection for it as a cultural treasure. Steve MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Roxanne (1987) remains a sweet contemporary reimagining. But the one everyone refers to, the one against which the rest are invariably measured, is the 1950 Cyrano de Bergerac starring Jose Ferrer. \n\nStarring? HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the whole movie, filling it with bravura flair, making it dynamic, witty, ardent, playful. The others are dim satellites orbiting him at quite a remove. Not that it matters. RostandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extravagantly glorified reinvention of the real-life 17th century guardsman, freethinker, writer and swordsman, abundantly endowed with everything a hero needs, and over-abundantly endowed with a super-sized nose that at once becomes his despair and his motivation to overcompensate spectacularly, is the kind of role that gets actors drooling. For a while there was back-and-forth involving Laurence Olivier and his wife, Vivien Leigh, as Cyrano and Roxanne, the beautiful cousin he loves, but dares not approach for fear sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll laugh at his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpoor big devil of a nose.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ OlivierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s love of stage noses was well-known, and likely was a lure. But an Olivier Cyrano was not to be. \n\nOrson Welles, whose appetite for extravagant gesture was even greater than OlivierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s was for plasticene, tried for a decade to get financing for a Cyrano film. He even hired his friend, the great Paris-based designer Alexandre Trauner, to design the production. Some of TraunerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s designs made it into the eventual film. But Welles didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Instead, producer Stanley Kramer, who emerged with the rights, settled on Ferrer. Like his fellow Princeton alum, Jimmy Stewart, the Puerto Rican-born, New York-raised, and Swiss-schooled Ferrer, came to film by way of the Princeton Triangle Club (a private recording featuring Ferrer and Stewart is one of the holy grails of record-collecting!) and Broadway. Although he had only made his Hollywood debut two years before in 1948, snagging an OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nomination in the epic Joan of Arc alongside Ingrid Bergman, Ferrer had starred in Cyrano on Broadway since 1946, and won a Tony for the performance that also was to win him a Best Actor OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®. \n\nThus he was no stranger to the swordplay, the buckles, the capes, the boots and the white plume of freedom with which the fiercely proud Cyrano topped his plain hat. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part of CyranoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appeal. With sword and wit far nimbler than those of the nobles he mocked, the functional plainness of his dress, devoid of ribbons and lace, is in itself a statement of his rugged individualism. But Rostand and Ferrer take the sting out of CyranoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s swagger by making sure to provide a more than compensating internal grace and nobility of soul. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the core of Cyrano, and Ferrer uses the close-ups to make sure weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re never unaware of the suffering concealed by his panache. In a brilliant stroke of dramatic irony, Rostand not only keeps him from the thing he wants most ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the love of his beautiful cousin, Roxanne ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but turns him into his own worst enemy on the romance front when heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pressed into service as the protector and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ worse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mouthpiece for Christian, the handsome, noble, but hopelessly wooden and dim comrade Roxanne adores. You wonder how Rostand and Cyrano can possibly top their brilliant opening set piece, where before a scandalized, then titillated, audience in a theater, he banishes a hammy actor from the stage and pretends to nonchalantly fight a duel to the death after picking a fight with a condescending noble after another dared seem to notice CyranoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nose. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the famous Twenty Ways to Insult a Nose speech Cyrano delivers, one-upping the cloddish aristocrat by telling him how he could have insulted CyranoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nose with wit and style, instead of mere rudeness. Moments later, as he completes a ballad he improvises during the duel, he skewers an even more condescending high-born wretch. Swordplay spiced by class warfare? Not since Mercutio has a duel so sparkled. Where can he possibly go from there, but down, you wonder, until he takes over-the-topness to a new place by dueling 100 sword-wielding would-be assassins in a dark street, exhilarated by the emotions unleashed after Roxanne invites him to a meeting the next morning. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI am a storm,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he shouts. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll fight 100 armies. I have 10 hearts. I have 100 arms. Bring me giants!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ And heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the man to take them on. Until Roxanne, oblivious to his love for her, deflates him by asking him to babysit the earnest but inexperienced and far less worthy Christian. \n\nStoically, Cyrano resigns himself to lovelessness. Not only that. Because Christian is so wooden, tongue-tied and fundamentally non-verbal, he becomes ChristianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mouthpiece, using his words and eloquence to win for another the woman he loves in a deft parody of ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. Until then, Rostand had been parodying DumasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Three Musketeers, upping the ante by rolling all three into one. Not that Ferrer is a mindless Romantic superhero with a nose that makes PinocchioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seem a pencil stub. His performance is more subtle and complex than it first might appear. During the sword fighting, the alertness in his eyes tells us heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taking it seriously, never overconfident, as calculating as he is impulsive. Ferrer uses his baritone voice to advantage, too ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ using it to bring a somber undertone to many of the pronouncements of this cavalier, with his passionate heart doomed to remain on the outskirts of love. \n\nRostand was too knowing a sophisticate not to layer Cyrano with more than heroics, including heroic renunciation. One reason the play clicked with audiences at the time was that it played to FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fin de siecle view of the mid-17th century as FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Golden Age. Its romanticism in a romantic era didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hurt, either. Yet even here, Rostand seems to be satirizing the idea of romantic love in his ironic portrait of the idealized Roxanne as a callow baggage, played by Mala Powers as a beauty of extremely limited vision, taken by the external beauty of the pretty boy Christian, oblivious to the internal beauty, depth, grandeur and generosity of Cyrano. William PrinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Christian is essentially consigned to male bimbo status. Perhaps relenting, Rostand allows him the biggest laugh. When he tells Cyrano he feels he ought to speak for himself, and Cyrano lets him, he almost ruins it for himself with Roxanne. When he looks longingly at her and says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI love you,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ she replies, expectantly, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes, and?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He gulps and says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI love you...very much.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ She can hardly hide her disappointment. Of course, Cyrano steps back in, hidden in the shadows, to save the day with his verbal inventiveness. \n\nShadows count for a lot here. This black and white film, when it finally got made, was a low-budget affair. Producers Kramer and Carl Foreman made it work for them. It has a boxy look and a stagy feel. Certainly this must have aided FerrerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance, shaped, as it was, by the stage production. Deliberately, the film begins with the opening of a fleur de lys-festooned curtain, embracing the artifice. Better this approach, you feel as the film proceeds, than panoramic realism. Cyrano de Bergerac is, above all, a construct. Brian HookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deft translation reminds us that Cyrano is more about its couplets than its couples. Far from being hindered by its flavor of artifice, riding FerrerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grand gestures and sonorous cadences, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reinforced. \n\nThe screenplay for the film, written by Carl Foreman, was mostly faithful to the play and to Brian Hookers translation, though it was trimmed to 113 minutes (Cyrano plays for more than two-and-a-half hours onstage). However, Foreman did add his own dialogue for two or three additional scenes inserted into the film for better continuity between the five acts of the original play, and these are obviously not in verse.\n\nThe play characters of Le Bret and Carbon de Castel-Jaloux were combined, as were those of Ragueneau and Ligniere (although Ragueneau is not a drunk in the film). Le Bret consequently has a much larger and more important role in the film than in the play, and Ragueneaus role is slightly increased by his being the one threatened by a hundred ruffians that Cyrano fights off. The fight is shown in the film; in the play it takes place offstage between Acts I and II (Cyrano is in five acts).\n\nThe role of the unnamed cardinal (Richelieu, to judge from his appearance) was especially written for the film.\n\nIn the film, Cyrano dies after being trampled by a carriage as part of an ambush rather than by being hit on the head by a falling log as in the play. As with the fight against the hundred ruffians, the attack on Cyrano is shown onscreen rather than taking place offstage. Previous to this, there is a new scene in which his enemies are seen discussing the possibility of his being killed in a so-called accidental way.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b2463b0101206f219ff551a25ce10e78dbd59f","amp;dn":"Cyrano+de+Bergerac+%5B1950%5D+Jose+Ferrer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b2463b0101206f219ff551a25ce10e78dbd59f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,178,70,59,1,1,32,111,33,159,245,81,162,92,225,14,120,219,213,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
