Hood pointed out that everyone has some amount of superstitious belief by posing the following questions: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Could you wear clothing that belonged to a serial killer? \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Could you swap your wedding ring or other sentimental object for a duplicate? \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Could you stab a photograph of a loved one through the eyes with a pair of scissors?\nTo further illustrate the power of superstitions, Hood referred to a study that found more Californian Asians die on the fourth day of the month than any other day. The Chinese and Japanese words for the number 4 sound just like their word for 'death', he noted. Rituals, such as those performed by athletes before their games, can help people gain a sense of control over their superstitious beliefs, Hood added. \n\n\n-vaccine-a.com\nBook(s):\n-Vaccine A: The Covert Government Experiment That's Killing Our Soldiers\n-The Science of Superstition: How the Developing Brain Creates Supernatural Beliefs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e86f82c2c58c21951d2d1dcf0a633bb82b8950","amp;dn":"Coast+To+Coast+Am+-+08-14-10+-+Covert+Gov%5C%27t+Vaccine+Experiment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e86f82c2c58c21951d2d1dcf0a633bb82b8950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,232,111,130,194,197,140,33,149,29,45,29,207,10,99,59,184,43,137,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
