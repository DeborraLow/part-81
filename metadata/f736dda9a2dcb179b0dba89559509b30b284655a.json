Put the PS3 folder that you've just downloaded onto your USB\n2. System Update &gt; Via Storage Media\n3. Install away and now wait for PSN to be turned back online!\n\nHappy Days!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f736dda9a2dcb179b0dba89559509b30b284655a","amp;dn":"Playstation+3+Official+Firmware+Update+v3.61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f736dda9a2dcb179b0dba89559509b30b284655a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,54,221,169,162,220,177,121,176,219,168,149,89,80,155,48,178,132,101,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
