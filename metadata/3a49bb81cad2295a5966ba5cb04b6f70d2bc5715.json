Their 2009 debut saw this power trio from Warsaw hailed as one\n  of the best bands in europe and this new EP is a step up again, maybe one of\n  the best independent releases of the year. The material for the Ruins EP was\n  recorded on analog tape at the Prusiewicz Sound Studio near Krakow. Having\n  entrusted the mastering of their debut LP to the Appleseed Cast's Chris\n  Crisci, the musicians have once again chosen to work with the best in the\n  field ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ New York's Turtle Tone Studios. Michael Fossenkemper, who has worked\n  with such artists as The Get Up Kids, The Casket Lottery, Coalesce, The\n  Umbrellas, Brandtson and Dizzee Rascal, is the man behind the final sound of\n  Ruins.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
