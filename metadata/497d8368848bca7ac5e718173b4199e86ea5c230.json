He obtained a BMI award for co-writing and singing on one of the most frequently aired rock radio hits of 1992 and 1993, &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got A Lot To Learn About Love&quot;', by The Storm. In 1994, he temporarily replaced Steve Perry in Journey, and in 2003, he toured as lead vocalist for the Alan Parsons Live Project\n\nChalfant's first national success came when he joined AOR group 707 in 1982. With Chalfant on lead vocals, the band enjoyed its biggest hit, &quot;Mega Force&quot;, which peaked at #12 on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock chart. That success, however, was not enough to assuage internal conflicts and the group disbanded before a follow-up could be recorded.\n\nIn 1984, Chalfant joined the band Steel Breeze. He recorded one album with the band, Heart on the Line, before leaving in 1985. Around that time he sang &quot;Hold On to the Vision&quot;, the theme to the film No Retreat, No Surrender, featuring Joe Satriani on guitar.\n\nChalfant later formed The Storm in 1990 with guitarist Josh Ramos and former Journey members Ross Valory (bass), Gregg Rolie (keys) and Steve Smith (drums).\n\nLyrics\n------\nNobody told you, that you'd face the truth alone\nBut you got the power to begin\nLet your self wonder, let your spirit find the way\nand reach for the power from within\n\nYou got no reason to let people keep you down\nStand up and fight for what you are\nAnd your biggest challenge\nis the one that lies within yourself\nknow what you're fighting for\n\n\nHold on to the Vision in your eyes\nKeep the Fire burning bright\ngot to make them realized\nOnly with this power can you rise\nHold on to that Vision in your eyes\n\n\nNever surrender,to the clouds inside your mind\nNever retreat from who you are\nknow - Love is a magic that you carry on in on, in on, in on\nKnow what you're fighting for\n\n\nHold on to the Vision in your eyes\nKeep the Fire burning bright\ngot to make them realized\nOnly with this power can you rise\nHold on to that Vision in your eyes\n\n...................................................................................\n\nThis file is MP4 compatible and can be played on any MP4 player.
