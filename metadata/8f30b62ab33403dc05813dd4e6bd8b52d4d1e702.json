Inevitably, the resulting hybrids skirt the line between appropriation and inspiration and run the risk of coming off as turgid or contrived. On its second album, See It Another Way, the Athens, GA band Macha navigates that danger with ease, and the result is an album deep in soul-searing songs and astounding musical evocation that, indeed, hits on a tangible mysticism, whether it means to or not. The East to which Macha looks is Indonesia and comes by way of traditional gamelan instruments such as Sumatran gongs and Javanese zither, which instead of drums, bass, or keyboards (also present in the music) act as the driving force of the songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f30b62ab33403dc05813dd4e6bd8b52d4d1e702","amp;dn":"Macha+-+See+It+Another+Way","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f30b62ab33403dc05813dd4e6bd8b52d4d1e702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,48,182,42,179,52,3,220,5,129,61,212,230,189,139,82,212,209,231,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
