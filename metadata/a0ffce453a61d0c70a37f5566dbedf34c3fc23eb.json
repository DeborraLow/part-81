He countered Republican budget plans with what he said was a more balanced approach that relies in part on tax increases for the wealthy as well as on spending cuts. The Congressional Progressive Caucus meanwhile has unveiled an alternative plan called &quot;The People's Budget.&quot; We speak to Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\n\n- Roundtable: Assessing Obama's Budget Plan &amp; State of U.S. Economy With Author Thomas Frank, Rev. Jim Wallis, and Activist/Philosopher Grace Lee Boggs\n\nTo discuss President Obama's budget talk and the state of the American economy we are joined by three guests: Thomas Frank, a columnist at Harper's Magazine and the author of several books including &quot;The Wrecking Crew: How Conservatives Ruined Government, Enriched Themselves and Beggarded the Nation&quot;; Rev. Jim Wallis, the founder of the Sojourners Community and editor of Sojourners Magazine., who has been on a hunger fast since March 28 to protest Congressional budget cuts; and Grace Lee Boggs, 95-year-old activist, author and philosopher based in Detroit. She has been involved with the civil rights, Black Power, labor, environmental justice, and feminist movements over the past seven decades. Her new book &quot;The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism For the Twenty-First Century&quot; has just been published.\n\n\n- Grace Lee Boggs on Detroit and &quot;The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism For the Twenty-First Century&quot;\n\nWe discuss the state of the economy in Detroit, &quot;ground zero&quot; for the economic downturn in the United States, with civil rights activist and author, Grace Lee Boggs. &quot;In Detroit, because of the devastation of the industry relations, we recognize we have to re-imagine work, we have to re-imagine how we relate to each other,&quot; Boggs says. &quot;I think it is very difficult for someone who does not live in Detroit to say you can look at a vacant lot and instead of seeing devastation, it you see hope,&quot; says Boggs. &quot;You see the opportunity to grow your own food, see an opportunity to give young people a sense of process that is very difficult in the city. The vacant lot represents the possibilities for cultural revolution.&quot;\n\n\n- Its a Hoax: GE Does Not Plan To Return $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to U.S. Treasury\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Wednesday that &quot;General Electric announced it will repay its entire $3.2 billion tax refund to the U.S. Treasury on April 18.&quot; The company's tax record has been in the spotlight since The New York Times reported it paid no federal incomes taxes last year despite earning $14.2 billion in worldwide profits. It turns out AP's story was based on a press release that was actually written by members of the group US Uncut, a new organization that describes itself as a &quot;grassroots movement taking direct action against corporate tax cheats.&quot; We are joined by Andrew Boyd, a member of US Uncut.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ffce453a61d0c70a37f5566dbedf34c3fc23eb","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+14+apr+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ffce453a61d0c70a37f5566dbedf34c3fc23eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,255,206,69,58,97,208,199,10,55,245,86,109,190,223,52,195,252,35,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
