I highly recommend this little collection especially if you enjoy Kyell's other books in the Argaea universe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34348e2ffb6a59ef318a104f8556808f097e2f53","amp;dn":"Kyell+Gold+-+Argaea+short+stories+%5BAdult+Gay+Furry%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34348e2ffb6a59ef318a104f8556808f097e2f53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,52,142,47,251,106,89,239,49,138,16,79,133,86,128,143,9,126,47,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
