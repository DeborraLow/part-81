reinvent his career, actor Dax Shepard  makes\n        a  rash decision  to abandon  comedy in  pursuit of  his true\n        dream: to become an internationally-renown martial arts star.\n\n        Without any formal martial arts training, nor adequate funding\n        for his &quot;blockbuster&quot; action movie, Dax (from 'When in  Rome')\n        enlists the help of his buddies, including producer Nate Tuck,\n        Tom  Arnold  (from  True  Lies'),  Bradley  Cooper  (from 'The\n        Hangover'),   David  Koechner   (from  'Anchorman'),   Michael\n        Rosenbaun  (from  TV's 'Smallville'),  and  Jon Favreau  (from\n        'Iron Man' I and II).\n\n        Together,  they  fight  to realise  Dax's  true  passion while\n        facing rejection  at every  turn. Their  bizarre path  becomes\n        increasingly nonsensical and  destructive, all at  the expense\n        and exploitation of Dax's relationships.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                  Tom Arnold         ....
