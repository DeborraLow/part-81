When Jesus walks on the water, kids will feel like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“re in the boat. When Peter waits in the courtyard during the LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s trial, the fire will crackle. The ambient sounds of the Holy land, the breath-taking musical score, the world-class young actors and the timeless Word of Promise all combine to deliver an unparalleled achievement.\n\nThis is the New Testament only. The Old Testament not out yet. The version of the bible used is International ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s Bible.\n\nIt should be MP3 Player friendly as each chapter has been painstakingly IDed to work with your favorite MP3 player.\n\nOne mistake is Acts 05 (2) which is really Acts 6.\n\nVisit the Official website:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f455bb2cc144acaebd080afeef0e26feab5a45ed","amp;dn":"Word+of+Promise+Next+Generation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f455bb2cc144acaebd080afeef0e26feab5a45ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,85,187,44,193,68,172,174,189,8,10,254,239,14,38,254,171,90,69,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
