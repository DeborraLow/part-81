As a result, a lot of people dialed wrong and got him by mistake. He decided to take advantage of the situation by pretending to be a real tech support representative and he recorded the calls and released them on this extremely funny CD. These are real calls and remember, THEY CALLED HIM!\n\nIf you like this CD, buy it.
