Includes lots of liveries, and very realistic flight dynamics as well as the FSX default 737 Panel.\n\nSadly, as this is a FS2004 native model, it didn't come with a VC and I can't import one from FSX, so for now, this does not have a Virtual Cockpit.\n\nSeed please!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f9c045f295f05515925214701bb40a6a7c0def","amp;dn":"FSX%2FFS2004+-+DC9-50+Freeware+addon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f9c045f295f05515925214701bb40a6a7c0def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,249,192,69,242,149,240,85,21,146,82,20,112,27,180,10,106,124,13,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
