But killing Max Jenke only elevated him to another level of reality. Now Lucas\\' family is under attack, his sanity in question, and his house haunted. Aided by a disreputable college professor, can Lucas reclaim his mind, house, and family? Features Lance Henriksen as the Lucas McCarthy and Brion James as Max Jenke. One of the few movies featuring these actors as main characters. \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097527/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097527/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCouldn't find this movie here.
