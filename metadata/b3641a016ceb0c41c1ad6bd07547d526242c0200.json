It was a risky time both spiritually and politically. The Pharaoh had not prepared anything for his journey to the afterlife, nor had he named a successor. Tradition dictated that he must be buried within 70 days, and there were several pretenders to his throne.\n\nNow an international team of Egyptologists investigates his burial. Their painstaking detective work reveals his burial was a rush job. Reuse and recycling was the order of the day as powerful people competed to claim his vacant throne.\n\nTutankhamun came to the throne as a boy, ruling for just 10 years before he died of unknown causes. He left no heir, prompting an extraordinary series of events. Egyptologist Dr Peter J. Brand of the University of Memphis explores the three main contenders: TutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widow, Ankhesenamun, possibly his half sister; the shadowy, nefarious Egyptian courtier Ay; and the man who seems to have been TutankhamunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intended successor, the stalwart General Horemheb.\n\nThe program explores how the political intrigue impacted on the preparations for TutankhamunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s burial. Tradition dictated that a pharaoh be buried after 70 days ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the amount of time it would take to mummify the body.\n\nDr Salima Ikram of the American University in Cairo, is one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading experts on the mummy in ancient Egypt. She investigates why TutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mummification is unlike others of the 18th and 19th dynasties.\n\nNote:This documentary goes some way to explain the attack of the Christian Pharaoh, and how his son stole the past works for his glorification and the re-establishment of the priest class.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3641a016ceb0c41c1ad6bd07547d526242c0200","amp;dn":"The+Race+To+Bury+King+Tut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3641a016ceb0c41c1ad6bd07547d526242c0200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,100,26,1,108,235,12,65,193,173,107,208,117,71,213,38,36,44,2,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
