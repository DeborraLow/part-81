I love albums which have the confidence to start gently, letting you drift into the record. Slow is also one of Chris EckmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademarks, remember his cover of Yellow Submarine for The Mojo magazine free cd called Revolver Reloaded (2006)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nKnown as the frontman-composer, producer &amp; songwriter of The Walkabouts, Eckman is living since few years now in Slovenia, consequently the culture of this European country started to influence his work and as a result you have The Last Side of the Mountain (November, 2008 - Glitterhouse). For that album Eckman translated and set into music eleven poems by the Slovene poet Dane Zajc and recorded them at Studio Zuma his personal studio in Ljubljana.\nThe Last Side of the Mountain is a very beautiful record and with no doubt this is EckmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest work to date, with or without The Walkabouts. This is simply a breathtaking album. For the melancholy flowing from the dozen tracks of The Last Side of the Mountain, for the lyrics, for the enchanting melodies perfectly produced, you have reason enough to love it. Just two small negative remarks, the mournful voice of Chris Eckman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sorry, Chris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and one track that I feel like skipping, The Same, performed with Steve Wynn, that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really fit with the other songs on this album. Besides you have gems like Scorpions, With What Mouth and the moving Who Will Light Your Path?, a beautiful song ala Elysian Fields, wherein polish vocalist Anita Lipnicka adds sublime harmony vocals.\n\n1. Bells Of A New Day \n2. Down, Down\n3. Eyes\n4. Ransom\n5. Who Will Light Your Path? \n6. Stranger\n7. Scorpions\n8. Hours\n9. The Same\n10. With What Mouth\n11. The Last Side Of The Mountain\n12. Fragment \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c87caafb08d089ee8d517fd1a72014e9291cfb","amp;dn":"Chris+Eckman...+The+Last+Side+Of+The+Mountain%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c87caafb08d089ee8d517fd1a72014e9291cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,200,124,170,251,8,208,137,238,141,81,127,209,167,32,20,233,41,28,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
