Their motivation is clear: if you are a temporary, part-time or self-employed worker you don't qualify for government help. The result is that many can't make ends meet and afford to feed themselves and their families.\n...\nToday, more than 37 million Americans receive either state or private food assistance. More than three million were made homeless in 2009 despite holding down jobs. More than half of those living in shelters have had their homes repossessed by banks.\n...\nThe US economy is in recovery but many experts believe the most damaging effects have yet to be felt. It's predicted that another 1.5 million people will be forced into homelessness within two years, and in a country with few safety nets, many more people could fall through the cracks.\n\nmore info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2010/episode-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2010/episode-9&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nFile Name .............: Unreported World - America - Down and Out.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 202,393,600 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 23:53.040 (35826 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nframe Size ............: 624x352 [=1.773]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 994 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.181 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 122 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\n\n-----\n\n[b]Channel 4 - Unreported World[/b]\n\nCritically acclaimed foreign affairs series offering an insight into the lives of people in some of the most neglected parts of the planet\n\n[i]Unreported World[/i] website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7b43e7f2cd579b9796a4f86c93c6cb05680d47","amp;dn":"Unreported+World+-+America%3A+Down+and+Out+-+25+June+2010+%28PDTV.Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7b43e7f2cd579b9796a4f86c93c6cb05680d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,123,67,231,242,205,87,155,151,150,164,248,108,147,198,203,5,104,13,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
