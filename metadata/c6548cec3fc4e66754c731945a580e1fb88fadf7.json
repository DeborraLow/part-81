Janet's\n                affair with a colleague is also uncovered, but has\n                Rachel overstepped the mark by confronting Janet\n                about it?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6548cec3fc4e66754c731945a580e1fb88fadf7","amp;dn":"Scott.And.Bailey.S01E04.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6548cec3fc4e66754c731945a580e1fb88fadf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,84,140,236,63,196,230,103,84,199,49,148,90,88,14,31,184,143,173,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
