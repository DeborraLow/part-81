Working with pianist Bobby Few,\nbassist Wilber Morris, and drummer Calyer Duncan, Howard leads his tight and\nexciting quartet through five original compositions, some, such as &quot;The\nBlessing&quot; and &quot;Schizophrenic Blues,&quot; are very much identified with the\nsaxophonist. Howard's playing is crisp, melodic, and clear, a tad less intense\nthan decades past, but nonetheless compelling. His alto retains the mournful\nwail of Ornette, but with a distinct identity. In an interesting twist, Howard\nblows on tenor sax on &quot;Lightning Rod, Pt. 1&quot; with the same power and\nforcefulness, but with a naturally deeper and more gutsy tone. Somehow, he seems\nless restrained on tenor, perhaps not as concerned with tone and more with pure\nenergy. Bobby Few and Wilber Morris are two of the best accompanists in the\nbusiness, and neither disappoints, although the bassist is a bit weak in the\nmix. Few, in particular, takes numerous solos, his vision and individual style\netched in the sand. Duncan, too, is a lesser known, but equally worthy sidekick,\nspurring Howard forward like a race driver in the midst of heated\ncompetition. Howard has made a few recordings through the years, and most are\nworth hearing. This may not be his best, but it nonetheless clearly reflects his\nstature as a giant in the genre of free improvisation.\n\nMore reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ayler.com/_catalogue_cd.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ayler.com/_catalogue_cd.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo (24 Mb): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ayler.com/images/ayvi/001970909/aylcd-001_noah_howard.wmv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ayler.com/images/ayvi/001970909/aylcd-001_noah_howard.wmv&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4ff88b582457f823ce34c8fb862d96c1374a2d","amp;dn":"Noah+Howard+Quartet+-+Live+At+The+Unity+Temple+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4ff88b582457f823ce34c8fb862d96c1374a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,79,248,139,88,36,87,248,35,206,52,200,251,134,45,150,193,55,74,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
