We have implemented the best of your requests for various features and product enhancements over the last two year period since the introduction of DC7, which is widely regarded as the gold standard in the field of audio restoration.\n\nClick Here for Full DC8 Details\n\nDC8 includes features like a Big Click Filter which will automatically repair the extremely large clicks created by a cracked or badly gouged record.\n\nIt has a Direct Spectral Editor which provides you with the ability to manually attenuate or interpolate very long-lived noise events found on live recordings like coughs, whistling, chair movement and other unwanted spurious signals. We have also augmented the performance of the manual interpolator through the use of a combination of time and frequency domain techniques.\n\nDC8 includes two very useful restoration effects called the Sub-Harmonic and the Overtone Synthesizer. These new effects help re-create the lost lower and upper octaves of a recording adding more life to your restorations.\n\nFile support has been extended to Broadcast Wave (BWF), FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis.\n\nThe built in CD burner now supports Disc-at-Once (gapless) CD creation along with CD text support. DC8 also supports Data Disc burning capability.\n\nThe DC Tune Library has expanded capability allowing you to use the Multifilter and all of its effects and presets on files being played. The DC Tune Library also now includes shuffle play and repeat play modes.\n\nThis is only a partial list of the features and improvements made to the Diamond Cut Audio Restoration software program. A complete list of DC8 features can be found here\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nWindows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 (any version)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1ae416b70cc657a796eaed1f23bece35a18bcd","amp;dn":"Diamond.Cut.v8.0.2.+Best+Audio+Restoration+Software.%7Bvery+rare%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1ae416b70cc657a796eaed1f23bece35a18bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,26,228,22,183,12,198,87,167,150,234,237,31,35,190,206,53,161,139,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
