In 1991, things became too much for him, and he quit the band, starting a solo career. His first album, Izzy Stradlin &amp; the Ju Ju Hounds, was a bit more laid back than the music he created in Guns'n'Roses. He performed with Guns'n'Roses a few more times (2006), and stayed with the band, although on the background. His solo career continued.\n\nSince 2003, all of his solo albums are released on the internet, thanks to iTunes. Wave Of Heat is his latest album, and another great performance.\n\nSongs @ 320 kbps\n\n1.  Beat Up\n2.  Old Tune\n3.  Rollin Rollin\n4.  Gone\n5.  Difference\n6.  Waiting For My Ride\n7.  Job\n8.
