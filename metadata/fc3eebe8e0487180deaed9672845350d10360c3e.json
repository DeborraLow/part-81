After a rain delay the race was stopped and the remainder was postponed to Monday May 2. A total of 14 laps were completed on May 1. \nDue to the delays and TV contracts, the race was not able to go the scheduled 75 laps, and turned into a timed race. A total of 55 laps were completed.\nThis file contains:\n- Highlights from the Sunday laps including the start and some crashes. A good part of the 14 laps from Sunday were run under yellow.\n- All the racing from Monday.\n\n\nTechnical issues regarding .mkv files and some Media Players:\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nI recently bought a Patriot PBO Core Media Player and noticed that some .mkv files would play sound, but not video. The player did not recognize the video codec. \n\nAfter a bit of research I found that this happens with some Media Players. According to matroska.org the problem is &quot;broken/incomplete players&quot;. They have released a command line tool, &quot;mkclean tool&quot; which according to them: &quot;Also comes with mkWDclean to modify files in a way they can play in broken/incomplete players.&quot;\n\nThe &quot;mkclean tool&quot; can be downloaded from matroska.org\nThe steps to use the tool are very simple:\n- I did this in Windows XP\n- Extract the downloaded .zip file to a folder of your choice. I usually stick with short folder names when using command line tools to avoid problems. I suggest renaming the video file into something small and workable to avoid typos.\n- I will use &quot;c:\\mkclean&quot; as the folder name and &quot;movie.mkv&quot; as the file name\n- Start a command prompt, then go to &quot;c:\\mkclean&quot; and type:\nmkWDclean movie.mkv\n\nThe process creates a new file with name &quot;clean.movie.mkv&quot;\nI was only getting sound and no video from this file in Patriot PBO Core Media Player, but after running it through &quot;mkWDclean&quot; the video works fine.\n\n\nRemember that this is free! If you have something positive to say great, if not, no one cares about your bitching!!\n\n\nDo your part, SHARE and SEED!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc3eebe8e0487180deaed9672845350d10360c3e","amp;dn":"IndyCar.2011.Round.04.x264.Eng-ezshare.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc3eebe8e0487180deaed9672845350d10360c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,62,235,232,224,72,113,128,222,174,217,103,40,69,53,13,16,54,12,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
