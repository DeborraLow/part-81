Based on the 1958 novel Dr. No by Ian Fleming, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkeley Mather. The film was directed by Terence Young, and produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that would continue until 1975. In the film, Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of a British agent. The trail leads him to the island home of reclusive Dr. Julius No. Bond uncovers Dr. No's plot to disrupt American rocket tests, and scuttles his operation. Dr. No's success, as the first major film adaptation of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, led to a series of films that continues to this day. Dr. No also launched a successful genre of &quot;secret agent&quot; films that flourished in the 1960s. It does not show Bond earning his double-0 status which grants him a licence to kill; instead it presents Bond as a seasoned veteran. Many of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in Dr. No, beginning with what is known as the gun barrel sequence, an introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel, and a highly stylized main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. In his work on film, production designer Ken Adam established a unique and expansive visual style that is the hallmark of the Bond film series.\n\nAlgemeen #0\nVolledige naam : C:\\Users\\danny\\AVCHD\\007 Dr No avchd dake 720p eng,dutch subs\\BDMV\\STREAM\\00000.m2ts\nFormaat : BluRay Video\nFormaat/Family : MPEG-2\nBestandsgrootte : 3.90 GiB\n\nVideo #0\nCodec : AVC\nCodec/Info : MPEG-4 AVC\nCodec-profiel : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d890b1bfb09894ebf6ea&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBreedte : 1280 pixels\nHoogte : 768 pixels\nBeeldverhouding : 1.667\nTaal : Engels\nPixelAspectRatio : 1.000\nDisplayAspectRatio : 1.667\n\nAudio #0\nCodec : AC3\nBitrate : 640 Kbps\nBitrate-modus : CBR\nKanaal(en) : 6 kanalen\nKanaalposities : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\nSamplerate : 48 KHz\nTaal : Engels ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4817bdf3255eb28a82423a0275096959ff03ddba","amp;dn":"+JAMES+BOND+007+Dr+No+1962+Blu-ray+rip+%28AVCHD+DAKE%29+720p+%28ENG%2FDU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4817bdf3255eb28a82423a0275096959ff03ddba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,23,189,243,37,94,178,138,130,66,58,2,117,9,105,89,255,3,221,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
