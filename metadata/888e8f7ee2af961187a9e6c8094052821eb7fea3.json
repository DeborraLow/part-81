Their recordings generally presented a mix of the three with classical influences sprinkled here and there, but it is on Ghosts that the band achieves the ultimate mix, with moody epics juxtaposed among lighter ditties and maudlin moments, all extremely well written, and executed with impeccable flair and confidence. This version of the group was the tightest, the same lineup present for Hero and Heroine but with an album under their belts. Ghosts is truly a group effort. The title track fatures ancient harpsichords melded to nightmarish guitars, &quot;Lemon Pie&quot; was a perky near hit, &quot;Starshine/Angel Wine&quot; begins gently with piano and cello before seguing into Clapton like riffs and majestic mellotrons. &quot;Where do you Go&quot; is a boppy pop number, but then it's back into the depressive with &quot;the Life Auction&quot; and its harsh observations awash in mellotron and guitars. &quot;Don't Try to Change Me&quot; is a Dave Lambert classic and its message is profound in a simple catchy way. If all of this wasn't enough, the album terminates with two of the most stunning tunes and poems in the Cousins' repertoire, &quot;You and I&quot;, featuring the brilliant John Hawken intro and Cousins sweetest vocals, not to mention a third verse where the band shows how harmonious it could be in the vocal department, and &quot;Grace Darling&quot;, here in this original incarnation performed as a hymn, with choir and organ providing the grace, and Dave Cousins for all the world sounding like a man who has found it. Ghosts is the best Strawbs effort in spite of some intense competition from its predecessors and the pressures for commercial success that must have existed at the time, but, thanks to its re-release, it is not to late to discover or rediscover this work of wonder. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\npplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888e8f7ee2af961187a9e6c8094052821eb7fea3","amp;dn":"Strawbs...Ghosts%281975%29remastered+%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888e8f7ee2af961187a9e6c8094052821eb7fea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,142,143,126,226,175,150,17,135,169,230,200,9,64,82,130,30,183,254,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
