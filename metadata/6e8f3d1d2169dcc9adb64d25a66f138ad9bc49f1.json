The\nreal shock was seeing just how female-dominated the orchestra is, with hardly a\nmale face among the violins.&quot;\n\n\nGustav Mahler Jugendorchester [Youth Orchestra]\n\nPaul Hindemith (1895ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1963)\n\nSymphony ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mathis der MalerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (1933ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4)\n\n1 Engelkonzert [Angel Concert]\n\n2 Grablegung [Entombment]\n\n3 Versuchung des Heiligen Antonius [Temptation of St Anthony]\n\n\nHindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Symphony ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mathis der MalerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mathis the PainterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) is often said to\nhave been extracted from his opera of the same name. Certainly the same music\nappears in both, but the symphony was the earlier work. In 1933, the year of the\nNazi seizure of power, Hindemith accepted the suggestion of his publisher Willy\nStrecker that he should compose an opera based on the life of the Renaissance\npainter Matthias GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newald (c1475/80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1528), whose real name was Mathis\nGothart Nithart. GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterpiece is the set of paintings executed at the\nbeginning of the 16th century on the altar for the hospital of the monastery at\nIsenheim in Alsace. Now preserved in Colmar, near Strasbourg, this Isenheim\naltar-piece is well known in Germany as one of the supreme treasures of late\nGerman medieval art.\n\nHindemith, writing his own libretto, decided to cast his opera Mathis der Maler in\nseven tableaux based on the Isenheim paintings, treating them as allegories of the\ncourse of MathisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career and of the events of his time, a turbulent era of religious\nstrife. In the character of Mathis, Hindemith created a figure who, as he wrote, is\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the embodiment of problems, wishes and doubts which have occupied the minds\nof all serious artists from remotest timesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The parallels with HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own\nposition, during GermanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contemporary political turmoil, were unmistakable.\n\nEven before he began the libretto, however, he started to compose some of the\nmusic, fulfilling a commission from Wilhelm FurtwÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngler for the Berlin Philharmonic.\nFirst, he composed a piece inspired by GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s painting of a concert of angels\n(Engelkonzert), intended to become the operaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prelude (eventually it also, with\nvoices added, became the basis of the Sixth Tableau). He then wrote a short slow\nmovement, evoking GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s picture of the Entombment of Christ\n(Grablegung). After some hesitation, Hindemith rounded off his commission with a\nlarge-scale finale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the long and virtuosic depiction of the Temptation of St Anthony\nwhich completes his symphonic triptych.\n\nFurtwÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nglerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world premiere of this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mathis der MalerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Symphony in Berlin on 12\nMarch 1934 was a resounding public and critical success. Shortly afterwards,\nhowever, the Nazi authorities began to impose a ban on performances of\nHindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, and the press began a hate-campaign against him.\nFurtwÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngler, who wanted the first production of the Mathis opera for Berlin,\npublished a newspaper article in HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defence, but only made matters\nworse. He himself was dismissed from his official posts until he made a humiliating\ncapitulation to the authorities, while Dr Goebbels personally attacked Hindemith at\nNazi party rallies. By the end of 1935 HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music was virtually unheard in\nhis native land; he was eventually forced into exile in Switzerland, where the Mathis\nopera was finally premiered in 1938.\n\nThe affair had drawn widespread attention and enhanced HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s international\nstanding. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MathisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Symphony was widely performed; even today it remains one\nof his most admired creations, its language more dramatic and lyrically appealing\nthan the somewhat utilitarian neo-Classicism of some of his 1920s works. In the\nsymphony his considerable polyphonic skill combines with a simplified and more\nstable harmonic sense, a melodic style often vocal or song-like, brilliant\ninstrumentation, and an enhanced conception of the imaginative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“interior spaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nthat the orchestra can create.\n\nThese qualities are manifest in the serene and luminous G major opening of the\nfirst movement, the Engelkonzert. HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enhanced interest in plainsong, and\nold German folk song comes to the fore as the trombones intone the melody Es\nsungen drei Engel ein sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ssen Gesang (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Three Angels sang a Sweet SongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), in D\nflat: the entire symphony is built around the opposing tonal poles of G and C\nsharp/D flat. After this slow introduction the movement becomes a joyous, almost\nchild-like Allegro on three principal themes, subjected to an ebullient and\nresourceful contrapuntal development. As events progress, the majestic tune of Es\nsungen drei Engel is combined with the dancing Allegro themes at the movementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nclimax, giving way to a coda of resplendent celestial hilarity, concluding in G.\n\nThe Grablegung slow movement is gravely elegiac, a kind of funereal nocturne\nwhich established the basic pattern for several of HindemithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later symphonic\nAdagios. (In the opera it follows the death of MathisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beloved Regina, the daughter\nof the leader of the peasants; and it returns, in the final scene, as the disillusioned\npainter renounces his art.) A solemn theme in slow march rhythm, for massed\nstrings and winds, is succeeded by a series of desolately beautiful woodwind solos.\nThe slow march returns and builds to an austere climax; the woodwind solos round\nthe movement off in a spirit of personal lament, in C sharp.\n\nThe finale is inscribed Ubi eras bone Jhesu / ubi eras, quare non affuisti / ut\nsanares vulnera mea? (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Good Jesus where wert thou, wherefore wert thou not\nthere to heal my wounds?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢). GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s painting of the Temptation of St Anthony\nshows the saint assailed and tortured by fantastic, misshapen creatures. In the\nopera this is re-enacted with Mathis as Anthony and the other characters as his\ndemonic tormentors.\n\nAfter an anguished, recitative-like introduction, the main part of the movement is a\nharried Allegro in C sharp minor, driven by obsessive ostinato rhythms, in several\ndramatic episodes. A prominent, aggressive descending four-note phrase\ntranscribes the demonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ cry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Wir plagen dichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“We torment you!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢). A brief, warmly\nlyrical Adagio for strings (the music of the beggar-maid) brings some assuagement,\nbut its allure becomes feverish, and the Allegro assault begins once more.\nEventually, however, a vigorous fugato in the strings reveals itself as the\naccompaniment to the Gregorian chant Lauda Sion salvatorem (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Praise thy\nsaviour, O SionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢). Here Hindemith alludes to another GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼newald painting, showing\nSt Anthony succoured in the desert by St Paul the Hermit: in the opera Cardinal\nAlbrecht, MathisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s patron and comforter, takes on the role of Paul. At last the music\nassumes clarity and resolution. With the full brass unfolding exultant Alleluias, the\nsymphony ends in the unshakable D flat major of the angelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ song.\n\nCalum MacDonald is a writer, lecturer and broadcaster, and Editor of Tempo. As\nMalcolm MacDonald he has written books on Brahms, John Foulds, Havergal\nBrian, Schoenberg and VarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨se\n\nGustav Mahler (1860ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1911)\n\nLieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (1883ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5)\n\n1 Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht [On my loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wedding day]\n\n2 Ging heutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ morgen ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼berÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Feld [This morning I walked across the meadow]\n\n3 Ich habÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ein glÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hend Messer [I have a glowing knife]\n\n4 Die zwei blauen Augen [My loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two blue eyes]\n\n\nMahler is sometimes described as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“song-symphonistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. His experiences as a\ncomposer of Lieder left their mark on each of his numbered symphonies. Several\nof the symphonies contain song-movements: the finale of the Fourth Symphony,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Das himmlische LebenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (The Heavenly Life), actually started life as an\nindependent song. But there are many other passages where the spirit of the Lied\nis invoked, even though no voices are heard. The middle movement of the\nunfinished 10th Symphony, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PurgatorioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, is song-like in form and character\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ its starting point is a figure from the eerie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Das irdische LebenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (The Earthly Life)\nfrom MahlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Des Knaben Wunderhorn songs. And what is the long trombone solo\nnear the start of the Third Symphony if not an elemental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“song without wordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢?\n\nThe Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Songs of a Wayfaring LadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), composed\nbetween 1883 and 1885, left a particularly strong imprint on the roughly\ncontemporary First Symphony. The first verse of the second song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ging heutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nmorgen ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼berÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s FeldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, forms the main theme of that symphonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first movement ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nand a fair amount of its continuation; while the final verse of the fourth song\n(beginning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Auf der Strasse steht ein LindenbaumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Upon the road there stands a\nlinden treeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) reappears as the Trio section of the First SymphonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sinister Funeral\nMarch. This connection emphasises something the casual reader of the Lieder\neines fahrenden Gesellen texts might miss: that the linden tree under which the\nwandering boy finds peace is a symbol of death. In the song, we have just a couple\nof bars of the opening funereal tune to cloud the quiet ecstasy of the singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final\nwords: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“All was well again! All! All! Love and sorrow, the world and dreams!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ That\nopposition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ warm, soothing hope one moment, cold emptiness the next ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is typical\nof Mahler.\n\nBut, however fascinating it may be to compare Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen\nand the First Symphony, each work is an independent creation. In fact, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possible\nto view the song-cycle as a kind of symphony in its own right. In terms of tempo,\nthe four songs complement each other like the movements of a symphony: slowish;\nmoderately fast; very fast; slow and march-like. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a continuously\nevolving tonal pattern, as in Symphonies Nos. 2, 5 and 7: D minorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“G minor; D\nmajorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“F sharp major; D minorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“E flat minor; E minorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nF major/minor.\n\nIn the symphonies, such ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“progressiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ schemes are often wedded to a kind of\nmusical narrative, but the story is rarely as explicit as it is here. A young man loses\nthe girl he loves to another man. He tries to console himself with the beauties of\nnature, but inside his pain burns as before. At last he finds consolation in the\nthought of death. There are clear parallels with one of the greatest song-cycles of\nthem all: SchubertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Winterreise. In both a man loses love and the promise of\nhappiness and walks away, towards oblivion. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a linden tree in SchubertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ncycle too, the subject of one of his best-loved songs. But where, in Schubert, the\nwinter landscape reflects the frozen grief of the wanderer, MahlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is clearly a\nspring journey: nature bursts into life and colour around the wayfaring lad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and yet\nhe cannot respond to it. MahlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s score paints this sad irony with music of exquisite\nbeauty and pathos. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to know anything about MahlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life at this time\nto sense that he identifies with the young hero of the poems. But the score of this\nfinal song is quite specific: Ohne SentimentalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤t ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Without sentimentalityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nno room here for self-pity.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26798318573176371447.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26798318573176371447.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nDuration                         : 2h 5mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1139 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eaa2838d82aaa6d9c4da&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nBit rate                         : 975 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.135\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 205 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e8f3d1d2169dcc9adb64d25a66f138ad9bc49f1","amp;dn":"BBC+Proms+2010+%5BGustav+Mahler%5D%5BMP4-AAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e8f3d1d2169dcc9adb64d25a66f138ad9bc49f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,143,61,29,33,105,220,201,173,182,77,37,166,111,19,138,217,188,73,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
