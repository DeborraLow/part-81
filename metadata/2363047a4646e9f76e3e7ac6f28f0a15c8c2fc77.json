Here she meets the oddest creatures imaginable, where doors lead into trees and claustrophobic halls where you shrink to three inches or grow to ten feet and get stuck in a vault. You can take tea with a Mad Hatter and play croquet with a Queen made-up as a playing card, listen to singing trees and talking flowers, or get advice from a hallucinating veteran caterpillar. But everything has a purpose, and the purpose here is to make Alice confident; it's not all fun and games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2363047a4646e9f76e3e7ac6f28f0a15c8c2fc77","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Wonderland+%281999%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2363047a4646e9f76e3e7ac6f28f0a15c8c2fc77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,99,4,122,70,70,233,247,110,62,122,198,242,143,10,21,200,194,252,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
