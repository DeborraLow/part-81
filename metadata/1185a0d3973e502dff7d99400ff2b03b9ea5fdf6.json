He met his girl friend Parm (Karen Black) one night while stealing her car and they stick together through everything Jay Jay gets involved in. While delivering a package of illicit drugs for local drug dealer and pimp Geek (Hector Elizondo) Jay Jay decides to steal it but is caught by the Police who agree to let him go if he turns &quot;narc&quot; and sets up the Geek in a sting operation with detective Danny (Robert De Niro), something Jay Jay doesn't want to do because he feels it will insure his death. Jay Jay arranges a meeting between Geek and Danny and gets some drugs for himself and shares with his friend Billy (Jay Fletcher) but the drugs turn out to be bad. Jay Jay and Parm decide to leave New York and on the way they are stopped by the Police who arrest Parm for possession of drugs. When Jay Jay goes back to Geek he is given some drugs but feels sure they are bad but is also so driven by his addiction that he is frozen with indecision. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066856&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066856&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGeneral: \n\nComplete name                    : Born to Win\\Born To Win.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 875 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 459 Kbps\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate                         : 1 000 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.139\nStream size                      : 600 MiB (69%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 269 MiB (31%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 32 ms (0.80 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 32 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1185a0d3973e502dff7d99400ff2b03b9ea5fdf6","amp;dn":"Born+to+Win+1971+DVDrip+English+Klam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1185a0d3973e502dff7d99400ff2b03b9ea5fdf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,133,160,211,151,62,80,45,255,125,153,64,15,242,176,59,158,165,253,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
