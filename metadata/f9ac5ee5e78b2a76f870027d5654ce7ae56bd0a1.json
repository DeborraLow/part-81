A true album, inspired by the near death experience endured by our friendly narrator, Mark Linkous. \nThe opener, &quot;Pig&quot; is pure punk greatness. Indeed, all of the uptempo tracks are pop magic. But the spider is the morphine induced head-nodding ballads that dominate the record -  like an I.V. drip to the left buttock in the gray/pink recovery ward. The record is held together by the stark, stream of consciousness psychedelic lyrics and phantasmagoric phrasing of our blissed out narrator.  Sparklehorse is radio transmissions through the noodle. Studio tweekings, squanks, strangeness and charm. Stunning song writing.  Gets my head noddin in the best way. \n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ac5ee5e78b2a76f870027d5654ce7ae56bd0a1","amp;dn":"Sparklehorse...Good+Morning+Spider%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ac5ee5e78b2a76f870027d5654ce7ae56bd0a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,172,94,229,231,139,42,118,248,112,2,125,86,84,206,122,229,107,208,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
