Woods, Jr.\n\nIdeas still matter, and sound economic education has rarely been as urgently necessary as it is today. There is no better bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦on the present crisis than this one, and that is why I am delighted to endorse and introduce itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦from the foreword by Congressman Ron Paul\n\nThe media tells us that deregulation and unfettered free markets have wrecked our economy and will continue to make things worse without a heavy dose of federal regulation. But the real blame lies elsewhere. In Meltdown, bestselling author Thomas E. Woods, Jr. unearths the real causes behind the collapse of housing values and the stock market, and it turns out the culprits reside more in Washington than on Wall Street.\n\nWoods busts the media myths and government spin. He explains how government intervention in the economy actually caused the housing bubble. Most important, Woods traces this most recent boom-and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“bust back to one of the most revered governmental institution of all: the Federal Reserve System, which allows busybody bureaucrats and ambitious politicians to pull the strings of our financial sector and manipulate the value of the very money we use.\n\nMeltdown also provides a timely history lesson to counter the current clamor for a new New Deal. The Great Depression, Woods demonstrates, was only as deep and as long as it was because of the government intervention by Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt. If you want to understand what caused the financial meltdown, and why none of the big-government solutions being tried today will work, Meltdown explains it all.\n\nThomas E. Woods, Jr. is a senior fellow at the Ludwig van Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama. He is the author or coauthor of nine books, including Who Killed the Constitution, The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush and the New York Times bestseller The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.\n\n6.5 Hours\n5 Compact Discs\n128 kbps\nmp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5fdfa14c27f6921bd019b0623b2a94fd190620","amp;dn":"Thomas+E.+Woods%2C+Jr.-Meltdown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5fdfa14c27f6921bd019b0623b2a94fd190620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,95,223,161,76,39,246,146,27,208,25,176,98,59,42,148,253,25,6,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
