Based on Gustav Hasford\\'s novel The Short Timers, the film\\'s first half details the volunteers\\' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a real-life drill instructor whose performance is one of the most terrifyingly realistic on record). Part two takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines. Ironically, Full Metal Jacket was filmed almost entirely in England. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 56 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MKV\n\n(MKV files will play as just an audio file in windows media player if you don\\'t have the correct codecs just download K-lite codec pack or another codec pack)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a744847f746ac4ef1d2f220847d229909256065","amp;dn":"Full+Metal+Jacket%281987%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a744847f746ac4ef1d2f220847d229909256065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,116,72,71,247,70,172,78,241,210,242,32,132,125,34,153,9,37,96,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
