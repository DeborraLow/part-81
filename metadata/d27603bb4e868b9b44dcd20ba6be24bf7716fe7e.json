He got a new orange magic marker in the mail and, without realizing just how &quot;magic&quot; it really was, immediately drew a monster who came to life and invaded his other drawings. Now, armed with his trusty reality-creating marker, Max sets off on a quest to capture him.\n\nVersion: 1.04\n\nLanguage: English &amp; 7 other languages.\n\nWebsite: http://maxandthemagicmarker.com/\n\nNOTE: I purchased it myself from www.trygames.com This is the original exe setup version of the game, not a custom made setup, not a self extracting archive &amp; nor a ISO image of a CD/DVD, thus it does not need activation or a crack. \n\nInstructions: 1. Install 2. Play &amp; Enjoy!
