The songs are less immediate and in your face, more slowly evolving and passive. This album demonstrates Engine Down at the top of their songwriting ability: putting together ambient sounds and beautiful interlocking clean guitar melodies, experimenting with different sounds such as keys and complex shifting song structures into something full and gorgeous.\n\nSource: CD\nReleased: 2000\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks: \n\n  1.
