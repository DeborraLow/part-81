During the mission Point Man learned that the man wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t working alone. In fact, the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic, cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically powerful mother, Alma WadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½products of ArmachamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perverse paranormal experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its inhabitants and almost all of Point ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s squad mates.\n \nFor months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear that AlmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s psychic influence survivedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and worse, her paranormal power is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her bloodline and reunite her family. ArmachamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s security force remains violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city, and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.\n \nWith the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots, where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted, yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebedaae895816511fb60d6c214c5fb27cb4e5d3","amp;dn":"F.E.A.R.+3+--+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebedaae895816511fb60d6c214c5fb27cb4e5d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,190,218,174,137,88,22,81,31,182,13,108,33,76,95,178,124,180,229,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
