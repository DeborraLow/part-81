It is admittedly an experimentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he is still a bit dazed, for instance, during the beginning of the blog. Yet in many ways, Alex is more calm and focused at home and in peace, allowing for greater reflection on humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bigger picture.\n\nLater, Alex picks up the recording again on his drive into the studio, analyzing the system as a hollowed-out wall plagued by termites, observing the police state that now surrounds us and commenting on a recent Supreme Court decision that encourages prosecutors to lie and fabricate evidence. Alex then shares some of his encounters in daily life with power-tripping cops, security guards and ordinary individuals. While his on-the-fly rantings may be a different pace from his radio show, there are plenty of golden nuggets throughout.\n\n\n[apparently recorded on Alex's iPhone; commercial-free; run-time 51:03]\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
