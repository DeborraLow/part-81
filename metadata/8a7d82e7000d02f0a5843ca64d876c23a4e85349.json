Fast and\nflexible, Harpoon?s powerful geometry and mesh controls are\ndriven through a simple and logical graphical user\ninterface (GUI). Crucially, Sharc?s experience in the\nmathematics of meshes ensure that the elements created will\nmeet the needs of even the most demanding solvers.\n\nQuality\n\nHarpoon is a fully automatic body-fitted hex-dominant\nmesher. The automatic generation of volume meshes and/or\nsurface meshes removes the need for time-consuming surface\nmesh generation and grid density specification.\n\nUnlike other meshers, Harpoon does not rely on\nnon-standard, nasty cut cells, but moves nodes of hexas\n(hexahedral elements) to maintain the grid's hex-dominant\nstructure and high quality cells. This results in meshes\nwith improved solution convergence.\n\nFlexibility\n\nHarpoon has direct interfaces for geometry exported from\nCATIA, Pro/E, IDEAS and many other commercial CAD packages.\n\nHarpoon provides export facilities for meshes for most\nmajor CFD/FEA codes such as Fluent, Star-CD, CFX5, Nastran\nand LS-Dyna. Click here for full list of supported import\nand export formats.\n\nMesh refinement for specific grid regions e.g. wakes, is\neasily specified in the GUI should the user require more\ncontrol over the mesh density.\n\nSpeed\n\nUsing state-of-the-art spatial algorithms and\npseudo-integer calculations, Harpoon delivers high quality\nmeshes at unrivalled speeds.\n\nTurn-around times from CAD to CFD solutions can now be\nreduced by orders of magnitude for large complex geometry\ncompared with other meshing tools and methods.\n\nSimplicity\n\nHarpoon does not require any mesh density specification to\nbe provided. Instead, Harpoon automatically calculates the\nmesh density required to capture all geometric details\nlarger than a given tolerance.\n\nWith a combination of the automatic feature extraction and\nan intuitive GUI, the user can generate volume and/or\nsurface meshes in just three mouse clicks.\n\nRobustness\n\nHarpoon automatically checks the generated mesh for\ninconsistencies and proceeds to repair any cells of\nundesirable quality. This routine requires no input from\nthe user and is integral to the whole meshing process.\n\nI N S T A L L\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) Place keyfile in program/game directory.\n3) Enjoy this release\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7d82e7000d02f0a5843ca64d876c23a4e85349","amp;dn":"+Sharc.Harpoon.v4.2a.MACOSX-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7d82e7000d02f0a5843ca64d876c23a4e85349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,125,130,231,0,13,2,240,165,132,60,166,77,135,108,35,164,232,83,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
