Based on a true story, kill the Irishman chronicles Greene's heroic rise from a tough Cleveland neighborhood to become an enforcer in the local mob. Turning the tables on loan shark Shondor Birns and allying himself with gangster John Nardi, Greene stops taking orders from the mafia and pursues his own power. Surviving countless assassination attempts from the mob and killing off anyone who went after him in retaliation, Danny Greene's infamous invincibility and notorious fearlessness eventually led to the collapse of mafia syndicates across the U.S. and also earned him the status of the man the mob couldn't kill.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 3/11/2011\n\n\nRay Stevenson as Danny Greene\nVincent D'Onofrio as John Nardi\nVal Kilmer as Joe Manditski\nChristopher Walken as Shondor Birns\nLinda Cardellini as Joan Madigan\nTony Darrow as Mikey Mendarolo\nRobert Davi as Ray Ferritto\nFionnula Flanagan as Grace O'Keefe\nBob Gunton as Jerry Merke\nJason Butler Harner as Art Sneperger\nVinnie Jones as Keith Ritson\nTony Lo Bianco as Jack Licavoli\nLaura Ramsey as Ellie O'Hara\nSteve Schirripa as Mike Frato\nPaul Sorvino as Tony Salerno\nMike Starr as Leo &quot;Lips&quot; Moceri\nMarcus Thomas as William &quot;Billy&quot; McComber\nVinny Vella as Frank Brancato\nBrian Balzerini as Valet\nCody Christian as Young Danny Greene\nDante Wildern as Young Billy McComber\nSean O'Reily as Tony Lupero\nVincent Rogo Angelini as Vic Centauro\nGrant Krause as Tommy Sinito\nJeff Chase as Joe Buka\nJim Porterfield as Stan Gilroy\n\n\nFormat: Matroska\nFile Size: 1.86 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 2 498 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 46mn\nSample: Included\nSubtitles: NO\n\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 2110\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 1280 X 720 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9 \nQuality Factor(QF): 0.095\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource: Blu-ray Disc @ TwiceHD Thanks !!\n\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 388 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels (Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE)\n\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4663faa873908a562b13d64a0c09fcc989fd0e4b","amp;dn":"Kill+The+Irishman+2011+720p+BDRip+x264+RmD+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4663faa873908a562b13d64a0c09fcc989fd0e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,99,250,168,115,144,138,86,43,19,214,74,12,9,252,201,137,253,14,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
