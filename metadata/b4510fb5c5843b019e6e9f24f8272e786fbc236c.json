The time limit made in unnecessary for the trailing team to foul deliberately, since it would get the ball after 24 seconds. The foul limit made it too costly to foul to prevent a chance at a basket.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The penalty for a backcourt foul became two shots ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ three to make two if you are over the limit.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Offensive fouls are treated as violations, no free throws and the defensive team gets possession. The foul would still count towards a playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s limit of six personal fouls. \n\n1964-65\n-------\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lane widened from 12 to 16 feet\nChange primarily attributed to the dominance of Wilt Chamberlain \n\n1966-67\n-------\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The team foul limit is reduced to five per quarter. In the last two minutes of any period, a team is allowed only one foul before the penalty, even if it hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t used up its allotment.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The following language was added to the Zone Defense Rule: &quot;After the offensive team has advanced the ball to its front court, a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds if it is apparent he is making no effort to play an opponent. The three second count starts when the offensive team is in clear control in the front court.&quot; \n\n1972-73\n-------\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ No foul shots are attempted, other than shooting fouls, until the fifth team foul of any period.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Other than the shooter, players are no longer restricted from entering the lane on free throws attempts.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Teams have 30 seconds to replace a disqualified player.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Errors in the fourth period and overtime must be discovered before the end of the period to be corrected. \n\n1974-75\n-------\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fine increased from $50 to $100 for a player or coach ejected after being charged with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A timeout request made at the instant time expires for a period shall not be granted and the period ends.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In the last two minutes of the game or overtime, no timeouts are allowed once the ball is inbounded until the ball is in the frontcourt.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforce outÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rule is clarified as incidental contact near a boundary line, which causes a player to commit a violation or go out of bounds, and neither team is responsible for the action. The offensive team retains possession.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ When there are punching fouls on both teams during the same play, the team last offended is awarded possession. \n\n1975-76\n-------\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ After any playing court violation, the ball is to be put into play at the sideline. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4510fb5c5843b019e6e9f24f8272e786fbc236c","amp;dn":"NBA.1976.FINALS.%2804+june%29.G5.PHX.Suns.vs.BOS.Celtics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4510fb5c5843b019e6e9f24f8272e786fbc236c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,81,15,181,197,132,59,1,158,110,159,36,248,39,46,120,111,188,35,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
