They were based out of the Jesus People USA Christian community in Chicago, Illinois, and most of its members continue to be part of that community to this day. Known for their blend of blues-rock and hard rock, Resurrection Band is credited as one of the forerunners of the Christian metal genre, releasing their debut in 1978. The band's greatest popularity was during the early 1980s, but later in the decade, they received some crossover success when they had two music videos featured on MTV.\n\nAlbums:\n\nMusic to Raise the Dead\n\n    Released: 1974\n    Format: Cassette\n    Label: Independent\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\n\nAwaiting Your Reply\n\n    Released: 1978\n    Format: LP/Cassette/8-track/CD re-issue\n    Label: Star Song\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nRainbow's End\n\n    Released: 1979\n    Format: LP/Cassette/8-track/CD re-issue\n    Label: Star Song\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nColours\n\n    Released: 1980\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Light Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nMommy Don't Love Daddy Anymore\n\n    Released: 1981\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Light Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nD.M.Z.\n\n    Released: 1982\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Light Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nLive Bootleg\n\n    Released: 1984\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Sparrow Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nHostage\n\n    Released: 1984\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Sparrow Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nBetween Heaven 'n Hell\n\n    Released: 1985\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD re-issue\n    Label: Sparrow Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nSilence Screams\n\n    Released: 1988\n    Format: LP/Cassette/CD\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band, Tom Cameron\n\nInnocent Blood\n\n    Released: 1989\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band, Tom Cameron\n\nCivil Rites\n\n    Released: 1991\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band, Tom Cameron\n\nXX Years Live\n\n    Released: 1992\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band, Tom Cameron\n\nReach of Love\n\n    Released: 1993\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band, Tom Cameron\n\nLament\n\n    Released: 1995\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Ty Tabor\n\nAmpendectomy\n\n    Released: 1997\n    Format: CD/Cassette\n    Label: Grrr Records\n    Producer: Resurrection Band\n\nI've used Itunes to organize the files, so Audio Info is almost complete....\nAbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15507f504009a5e3954916fc44b23a5f1d6b7a01","amp;dn":"Resurrection+Band+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15507f504009a5e3954916fc44b23a5f1d6b7a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,80,127,80,64,9,165,227,149,73,22,252,68,178,58,95,29,107,122,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
