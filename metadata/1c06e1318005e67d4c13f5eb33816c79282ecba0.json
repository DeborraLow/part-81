It's now 2011 and the band is gearing up for\nits biggest campaign yet. SUICIDE SILENCE will soon be entering the studio with\nheavyweight producer Steve Evetts (Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die,\nHatebreed) to create their most substantial piece of work to date. This summer,\nthe yet-to-be-titled record aims to redefine heavy and further the band's dominating\nforce within the extreme metal community.\n\nOTHER INFO:\nAnd now to real business. Today alone (so far) there have been 2 rips\n(ourselves and hardlyhxc) released that do not contain\nCOVERS/ART/BOOKLETS because they are pre retail/advance/promos. This has made\nthe mp3 scene what it is today, supplying a rip before any other group can.\nEven before the new rules were in effect we would supply pics of our discs,\nyou really think we are faking now?? Cmon. We have been releasing these ever\nsince we have formed as a group. The new rules do not take this into account,\nyou can clearly see from the proof pics the cd, case, a paper and my goddamned\ndirty carpet. There needs to be a revision rules.\n\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n1. Slaves to Substance (4:38)\n2. O.C.D. (2:35)\n3. Human Violence (5:20)\n4.
