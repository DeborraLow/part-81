What is it good for? Absolutely everything!\n\nUnlike  XviD  that  has  no real constant rate factor unless you are doing  full\nfirst  pass  only  the  x264 codec offers us a great option called CRF. What  it\nmeans  is  constant quality throughout an encode based on CRF value. You are  no\nlonger  limited  by some vague bitrate restriction you let the codec decide  for\nyou what bitrate is needed without size restrictions. If your source is full  on\naction,  grainy etc it will get a higher bitrate, if it's a dark action-free  it\nwill get less. No more obscenely large files for sources that don't need it,  no\nmore  shit  quality  cause  the  source  didn't  compress  but  did   meet   the\nbitrate/target  size. Does anyone really still archives on cdrs/dvdrs? not  many\nI would bet so who cares about DVDR/x sizes? If anything with CRF you'd be  able\nto  fit  even  more  eps into your DVD5 cause shows like Grey's Anatomy,  House,\nIn Treatment etc DO NOT need 1120mb sizes but far less.\n\nOther  benefits?  sure, right now every live from air x264 group finds the  most\ncunning ways to pre faster, so the bare minimum within allowed settings is used,\nwith CRF that can finally change. Settings can be upped, release sizes will  fit\nthe show and not some random bitrate setting. win win.\n\nA bit about CRF: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CRFGuide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CRFGuide&lt;/a&gt;\n\nConstant  Rate  Factor  will compress different frames by different amounts.  It\ndoes this by taking motion into account. The eye perceives more detail in  still\nobjects  than  when  they're in motion. Because of this, a video compressor  can\napply more compression (drop more detail) when things are moving, and apply less\ncompression (retain more detail) when things are still. Subjectively, the  video\nwill  seem  to  have higher quality. If you were a computer, you would look at a\nCRF  encoding  and  say it was lower quality than the CQP copy. And it would be.\nBut  if  you're  a  human being, subjectively, the CRF copy will look better. It\nleast  compresses  the parts you see the most, and most compresses the parts you\nsee  the  least. When you use a constant rate factor, it varies the QP slightly.\nWhen  a  scene has a lot of action and motion, it will raise the QP (compressing\nmore).  This  is because your eye will be distracted by everything going on, and\nwon't  have  the image on screen for enough time to see the heavier compression.\nWhen  a frame doesn't have a lot of motion, it will lower the QP, compressing it\nless.  This is because your eye will have more time to look at the image, so you\nwant  it  to  be  as  much  like the source as possible. When you use CRF you're\nsaying  &quot;use  whatever  bitrate  is  necessary  to  preserve  this much detail.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007d9c9c4c5373d79db6b01f414dd359e4c56cb0","amp;dn":"Smallville.S10E17.720p.HDTV.CRF.x264-IMMERSECRF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007d9c9c4c5373d79db6b01f414dd359e4c56cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,125,156,156,76,83,115,215,157,182,176,31,65,77,211,89,228,197,108,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
