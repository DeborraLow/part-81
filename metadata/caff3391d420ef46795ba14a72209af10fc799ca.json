Their driver, a local resident, expounds on the history of the churches while the wife translates. The photographer becomes jealous of his wife\\\\\\'s bonding with the driver. In a series of flash-forwards, the photographer stages identical dinners with several women, who pretend to talk on the phone while he writes. His wife, now estranged from him, leaves repeated messages on his answering machine, asking why he never contacts her. Yet another thought-provoking look into strange, intertwined relationships from the always enigmatic Egoyan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caff3391d420ef46795ba14a72209af10fc799ca","amp;dn":"Calendar+%28Atom+Egoyan%2C+1993%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caff3391d420ef46795ba14a72209af10fc799ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,255,51,145,212,32,239,70,121,91,161,74,114,32,154,241,15,199,153,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
