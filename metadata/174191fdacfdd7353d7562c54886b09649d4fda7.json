There was no war. Abandoned buildings and homes are peacefully still standing. In fact, there were no real signs of immediate danger.\n\nHow did the world fall to shambles, leaving nothing more than stories of what may have happened? The answers lie within a stranger that stumbles upon this small community of survivors with nothing more than an empty gun and a bloody wooden knife, fighting his way across the country looking for the answers. And the solution.\n\nTo find out what caused the world to end, and what anomalies now inhabit mother earth, our survivors along with this new stranger, must venture out into what may be the end of their livesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.helpimalive.tv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.helpimalive.tv&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Very ambitious!&quot; - Kevin Smith\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis teaser was shot exclusively for WonderCon 2011.\n\n-- CAST --\n\nLibby Ibarra ... little girl\nEthan Parsonage ...
