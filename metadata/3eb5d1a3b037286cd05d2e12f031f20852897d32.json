The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world. The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance. The expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game. Winter Assault promises to be one of the biggest expansion packs ever.\n-\n* First RTS expansion to add a completely unique, fully realized new race - The Imperial Guard\n* New units for all existing races\n* Brand new single player experience featuring 2 campaigns\n* More animations and sync kills\n* Fight in cold, harsh winter environments as well as unique SP maps\n* Advanced online experience including observer mode, arranged team play and improved automatch .\n\nSystem Requirements\nVideo Card : 64 Mb\nCPU : 1 GHz\nRam : 128 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb5d1a3b037286cd05d2e12f031f20852897d32","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40k+Dawn+Of+War+plus+Winter+Assault+Portable+-+%5BEspera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb5d1a3b037286cd05d2e12f031f20852897d32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,181,209,163,176,55,40,108,208,93,46,18,240,49,242,8,82,137,125,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
