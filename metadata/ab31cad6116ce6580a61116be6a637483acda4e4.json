Quality is pretty good. Unfortunately, the track &quot;The Poet And The Pendulum&quot; is screwed up and just repeats the first 4 minutes or so for 15. Other than that, it's okay, maybe a bit skippy at places. I didn't film or record this concert; I merely worked hard to find Nightwish bootlegs and decided to place it here so they're easier to find.\n\nTracklist:\n7 Days to the Wolves\nDead to the World\nThe Siren\nAmaranth\nRomanticide\nDead Boy's Poem\nThe Poet and the Pendulum\nNemo\nSahara\nThe Islander\nLast of the Wilds\nEscapist\nDark Chest of Wonders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab31cad6116ce6580a61116be6a637483acda4e4","amp;dn":"Nightwish-Pendulum+Over+Munich+%28Bootleg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab31cad6116ce6580a61116be6a637483acda4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,49,202,214,17,108,230,88,10,97,17,107,230,166,55,72,58,205,164,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
