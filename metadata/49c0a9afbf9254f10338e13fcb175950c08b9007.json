Many Ypsilanti residents appear as extras.\n\nplot\n\nYoung mother Madylyn Mabry puts her daughter to bed while her husband Jack watches golf on television. A bee buzzes around the window as she stays with her girl. After the child is asleep, she goes downstairs and announces she's leaving, saying &quot;You keep my soul in a dungeon.&quot; He takes a moment to disconnect from the game, then runs upstairs to the bedroom and holds their daughter out the window, threatening to drop her if Madylyn leaves. &quot;Do you think I won't? Do you think I won't?&quot; he yells at her. She agrees to stay but rushes to close the window, killing the bee that was a focal point earlier in the scene.\nMany years later, Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) and Madylyn (Frances Conroy) return home from church for a quiet afternoon in what appears to be an idyllic lifestyle of a long-married couple approaching retirement together. He watches TV and drinks in an identical pose to his younger self in the earlier scene, while she works on a jigsaw puzzle. Late that night a call wakes them. Jack picks up the phone and hears a woman's voice. &quot;Betsy?&quot; he asks, obviously distressed. We find him at church the next day, speaking at his brother Bobby's funeral.\n\nscreenz\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m26s0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m26s0.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m36s131.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m36s131.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m52s18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h06m52s18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h07m38s236.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h07m38s236.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h11m47s155.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/vlcsnap2011042812h11m47s155.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n        \nOVER ALL IMAGE\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/thumbs20110508200612.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgboot.com/user/deffjam555/images/thumbs20110508200612.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndo join my fan page if u have any requests and if u like my uploads\n\nFace book Fanpage and Movie request page\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://on(space).fb.me/Deffjam555&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://on(space).fb.me/Deffjam555&lt;/a&gt;\n\nremove &quot;(space)&quot; from above and paste it @ address bar \t\t\nor search &quot;Deffjam555 Torrents&quot; @ facebook\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c0a9afbf9254f10338e13fcb175950c08b9007","amp;dn":"Stone.2010.BRRip.x264.720p-%7Bdeff%7D%28PURE+RG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c0a9afbf9254f10338e13fcb175950c08b9007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,192,169,175,191,146,84,241,3,56,225,63,203,23,89,80,192,139,144,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
