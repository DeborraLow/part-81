Rename 54dbc743fd5b.update-SPH-M910_OTA_DI06ToEC07.zip to upgrade.zip\n2. Copy upgrade.zip to the root folder of your microSD card.\n3. Shut down your phone.\n4. Hold down the volume key, the send key and the stop key at the same time. If you do this in the right sequence, you will boot the phone into restore mode.\n5. Use the trackpad to select the choice that will apply update.zip to your phone.\n\nI have updated two phones so far, each took less than ten minutes and no data was lost. The only thing I had to do was to login back into my Google account.
