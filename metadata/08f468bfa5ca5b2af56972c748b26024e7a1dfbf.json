IMHO there are too many basic \norchestral soundtrack nowdays. Honestly how many memorable themes you\ncan remember in last ten years? Of course even good soundtrack doesn't always work\napart from the movie. Don't get me wrong there is a place for orchestral music\nbut I respect artist who can be creative. And when I say creative I of course\nmean Ennio Morricone - THE maestro. \n\nI tried to focus on orginal SCORES but there are couple of &quot;various artists&quot; \npicks. All the tracks should be ORGINAL and not the cheap synth\ncovers that you often stumble. A few crossover orchestral arrangements \nwith techy sounds also included. I just can't bypass Zimmer! Oh yes and there\nare tracks from the selected series also. \n\nSome classic themes are already included my previous compilations.\n[..] are not in tags.\n\nCOMMENTS are WELCOME!\n\n\nTRACKS:\n\n[01] Daft Punk - The Grid [From the movie Tron Legacy]\n[02] Goblin - Profondo Rosso (Album Version) [From the movie Profondo Rosso]\n[03] Air - Empty House [From the movie The Virgin Suicides] \n[04] Brad Fiedel - Gun Shop - Reese in Alley [From the movie The Terminator]\n[05] Archive - Nightmare Scene [From the movie Michel Vaillant]\n[06] Angelo Badalamenti &amp; Julee Cruise - Into the Night [From the series Twin Peaks]\n[07] Charles Bernstein - No Escape - Terror [From the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street]\n[08] Jerry Goldsmith - The Dream [From the movie Total Recall]\n[09] Clint Mansell - 2 Pi R [From the movie Pi]\n[10] Ennio Morricone - Humanity (Part II) [From the movie The Thing]\n[11] Eric Serra - Learning Time [From the movie Nikita]\n[12] John Carpenter &amp; Alan Howarth - The Bank Robbery [From the movie Escape From the New York]\n[13] Fabio Frizzi - Main Title (Zombi 2) [From the movie  Zombi 2]\n[14] Jean Michel Jarre - Theme de l'Argent [From the movie Les Granges Brulees]\n[15] Hans Zimmer - Leaving Wallbrook - On the Road [From the movie Rainman]\n[16] Harold Faltermeyer - Intro - Bakersfield [From the movie Running Man]\n[17] Joe Hisaishi - My Neighbor Totoro (Ending Song) [From the movie My Neighbor Totoro]\n[18] John Murphy - Theme 3 (End Credits) [From the movie 28 Weeks Later]\n[19] Moby - Extreme Ways [From the movie Bourne Indentity]\n[20] Orbital - The Saint [From the movie The Saint]\n[21] Jan Hammer - Tubbs and Valerie [From the series Miami Vice]\n[22] Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross - Intriguing Possibilities [From the movie Social Network]\n[23] Riz Ortolani - Cannibal Holocaust (End Theme) [From the movie Cannibal Holocaust]\n[24] Tangerine Dream - Tailed - The Break-In [From the movie Thief]\n[25] The Chemical Brothers - Container Park [From the movie Hanna]\n[26] JG Thirlwell - Fumblestealth [From the series The Venture Bros]\n[27] Tykwer; Klimek; Heil feat.
