This indie rock band from Little Rock, Arkansas and their bluesy garage-rock sound is breathtaking in its intensity and emotional release. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like making love outside in the pouring rain. And youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll love every minute of it.\n\nAmerican Princes unique lyrical, vocal, and musical combinations create a sound that ranges from Kings of Leon to the Chili Peppers, Cream to Bowie. Less and Less is a triumph of talent and imagination. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s raw but cultivated, passionate yet intelligent, retro and cutting-edge rock with provocative blues undercurrents. I loved this album but not without exception.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen LetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a lot of drum and rhythm guitar. David SladeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique vocals are gravelly, arousing and raw. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnnieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mixes acoustic guitar and synthesized strings that, together with SladeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rough, bordering on hushed, vocals create a sweet, innocent, wild-flowers-picked-from-an-obliging-field, lost-love kind of a song.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever Grow OldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the same throaty, carnal, vocals, emotive lyrics and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ what you soon learn is an American Princes trademark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ catchy riff. It will have you singing along before you even know all the words. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou &amp; ThemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is beautifully acoustic with reverently sung poignant lyrics.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBreaksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like a nod to Chris Isaak. Soft, melodic bass lines and pulsating beats drive SladeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intense, deep, sensual vocals to a wet, quivering, all but orgasmic brink.\n\nIt wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t true love however. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStolen BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like the Clash with soft bits and I never warmed to it. And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTV Keeps Me UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a skiffle nightmare that is out of place on what is otherwise an excellent album.\n\nThis album feels like sex on a CD. Less and Less is a sensual, sexual, throbbing, rock &amp; roll/ blues classic. And I think I may be in love.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7667d25fabfaec3b191a7275620cbf51587291f4","amp;dn":"American+Princes+-+Less+And+Less+%282006%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7667d25fabfaec3b191a7275620cbf51587291f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,103,210,95,171,250,236,59,25,26,114,117,98,12,191,81,88,114,145,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
