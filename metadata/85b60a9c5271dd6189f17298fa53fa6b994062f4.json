It expands on the game play of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and is the fourth installment in the popular Ghost Recon tactical shooter video game series, published by Ubisoft.\n\nThe game takes place in 2013 (although the back of the game's cover says 2014.[4]), immediately after the events of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (GRAW), just south of the United States border, and deals with the conflict between a Mexican rebel group, Mexican loyalists, and the U.S. Army for a time span of 72 hours. A wide array of location types are included, featuring mountains, small towns, urban environments, and a large hydro-electric dam just north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b60a9c5271dd6189f17298fa53fa6b994062f4","amp;dn":"GHOST+RECON2%3A+ADVANCED+WARFARE-XBOX360%5BREGIONFREE%5D+-+RespawnGame","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b60a9c5271dd6189f17298fa53fa6b994062f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,182,10,156,82,113,221,97,137,241,114,152,250,83,250,107,153,64,98,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
