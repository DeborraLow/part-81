Complicating matters is Alex's girlfriend, Melanie (Christina Horne), who has no idea that he's agreed to work with the police. Tom Jackson (North of 60) is probably the best known actor in this video.\n\nThe pilot is written by Michael Amo and is based on the book &quot;Befriend and Betray&quot; by Alex Caine. It is unclear whether it has been picked up as a series. It aired on Showcase Canada on April 30, 2011.\n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Befriend.and.Betray.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            734,222,336 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             1:27:46\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              992 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              111 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b8933585f33a05805e294615cb94c3b04dee51","amp;dn":"Befriend+and+Betray+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b8933585f33a05805e294615cb94c3b04dee51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,184,147,53,133,243,58,5,128,94,41,70,21,203,148,195,176,77,238,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
