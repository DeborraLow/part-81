The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.\nFor whatever reason dark areas of the original DVD appear slightly red. I also notice this on broadcast episodes and I think this is induced in the production of the show, but is more noticeable on the DVD's. This is not a rip defect.\n\nThere are no subtitles or alternate languages.\n\nFull episode descriptions can be found at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nNCIS, also known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nThe concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS. NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during Season 1; however, &quot;Navy&quot; was later dropped from the title as it was redundant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fa69ee68d6a9d7b97c34f9c212f5abf5b504e7","amp;dn":"NCIS+Complete+Season+1+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fa69ee68d6a9d7b97c34f9c212f5abf5b504e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,250,105,238,104,214,169,215,185,124,52,249,194,18,245,171,245,181,4,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
