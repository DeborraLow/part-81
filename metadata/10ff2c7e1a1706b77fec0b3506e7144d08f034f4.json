You Were Right\n\n--------------------\n\n\nThe first, unofficial, trailer from the new Australian movie, Fuck The War.\n\n&quot;In 2003, during anti-War On Iraq protests, the Australian prime minister was kidnapped by an activist and interrogated for 24 hours over the lies that led the country to war. The disappearance of the prime minister was officially covered up as an &quot;unexpected visit to the hospital&quot;, but a documentary maker, shooting interviews during the largest anti-war protests in Australian history, captured most of the interrogation on camera. Now, seven years later, that footage is being made public for the first time.&quot;\n\nFuck The War, directed by Darryl Mason, stars Dave Gleeson, lead singer with the legendary Australian rockers The Screaming Jets, and features interviews with some of the one million Australians who protested against the War On Iraq.\n\nComing to DVD and torrents in November, 2010.\n\n\nMore clips and info here :\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ff2c7e1a1706b77fec0b3506e7144d08f034f4","amp;dn":"Fuck+The+War+-+The+Bootleg+Trailer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ff2c7e1a1706b77fec0b3506e7144d08f034f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,255,44,126,26,23,6,183,127,236,11,53,6,231,20,77,8,240,52,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
