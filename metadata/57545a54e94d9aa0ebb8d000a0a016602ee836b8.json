This adventure in non-philosophy does not claim to think lor religion, but from it as material and with disinterest towards its sell-given status as ultimate authority. This provocative yet remarkably accessible book introduces philosophy to the lessons of heresy and makes use of them in a non-philosophical &quot;dualysis&quot; of messianism and apocalypticism. Laruelle investigates the &quot;heretic question&quot;, analogous to but historically distinguished from the &quot;Jewish question&quot;, to develop a &quot;non-Christian science&quot; that struggles against and for our World. Future Christ thus opens up novel ways of thinking within existing religious and philosophical thought and marks an incisive and wide-ranging non-philosophical engagement with key contemporary debates in philosophy and theology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57545a54e94d9aa0ebb8d000a0a016602ee836b8","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Future+Christ+A+Lesson+in+Heresy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57545a54e94d9aa0ebb8d000a0a016602ee836b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,84,90,84,233,77,154,160,235,184,208,0,160,160,22,96,46,232,54,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
