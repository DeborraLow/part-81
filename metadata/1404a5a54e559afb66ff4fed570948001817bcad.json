Here he's among friends.., and speaks far more freely than in the more formal interviews with the &quot;mainstream media&quot;.  Actually quite entertaining !!  :-)\n\nThis speech is particularly memorable.., mostly because Mr. Zundel offers his commentary on the (then) David Irving versus Deborah Lipstadt trial..,  the tolerance that revisionists have with other people's point of view.., the growing censorship laws in Canada.., how the internet is (and has) begun to be a powerful &quot;tool&quot; for revisionism (of ALL types!).., and he even comments on his early publications into esoteric topics.., such as UFOs !\n\nThe video is 56 minutes long, with a more than &quot;watchable&quot; clarity of about A8 / V7\n\nAs always.., after watching.., do your best to &quot;pass it on&quot;.....\n\n\n!!! Truth Does Not Fear Investigation !!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1404a5a54e559afb66ff4fed570948001817bcad","amp;dn":"Ernst+Zundel+-+ruggle+in+Canada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1404a5a54e559afb66ff4fed570948001817bcad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,4,165,165,78,85,154,251,102,255,79,237,87,9,72,0,24,23,188,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
