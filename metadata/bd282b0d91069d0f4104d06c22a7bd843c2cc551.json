John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in &quot;Catfish Hunter,&quot; a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. However, Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men proved to be the last role for veteran actor Burgess Meredith, who died two years after it was released.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 41 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd282b0d91069d0f4104d06c22a7bd843c2cc551","amp;dn":"Grumpier+Old+Men%281995%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd282b0d91069d0f4104d06c22a7bd843c2cc551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,40,43,13,145,6,157,15,65,4,208,108,34,167,189,132,60,44,197,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
