The system incorporates both subway and light rail lines. It opened in 1995, making Shanghai the third city in Mainland China, after Beijing and Tianjin, to have a rapid transit system. Since then, the Shanghai Metro has become one of the fastest-growing rapid transit systems in the world.\n\nAs of 2011, there are eleven metro lines (excluding the Shanghai Maglev Train), 273 stations and over 434 km of tracks in operation, the longest network in the world. In 2010, the Shanghai Metro delivered 2 billion rides, averaging 5.2 million per day, the fourth busiest in the world. It set a daily ridership record of 7.548 million on October 22, 2010. The system continues to grow, with new lines and extensions of old lines currently under construction.\n\n=====================================\n\nThese files are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic license.\n\nYou are free:\n\n* to share - to copy, distribute and transmit the work;\n* to remix - to adapt the work.\n\nUnder the following conditions:\n\n* attribution - You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work);\n* noncommercial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You may not use this work for commercial purposes.\n\n=====================================\n\nPreview:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAHLjaaDp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAHLjaaDp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAhLaAAdP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAhLaAAdP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oahLBAADP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oahLBAADP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaHLCAADp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaHLCAADp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc240d3c0a52307b7a8c5cf8de85c5498eb4210","amp;dn":"Shanghai+Metro+%28bricoleurbanism%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc240d3c0a52307b7a8c5cf8de85c5498eb4210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,194,64,211,192,165,35,7,183,168,197,207,141,232,92,84,152,235,66,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
