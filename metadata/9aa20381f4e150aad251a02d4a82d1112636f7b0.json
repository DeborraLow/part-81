The two oddball and rich uncles are played by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine. Even though the uncles have never raised any children, they accept the responsibility of taking care of Walter for the summer. Since they don't have a TV or telephone in the house, the uncles entertain Walter with colorful stories from their past when they were young and fighting for the Foreign Legion and Duvall's love affair with the Sultan's daughter. The stories are so fantastic that Walter is not sure if they are true or made-up by his uncles. The uncles purchase an old lion to hunt, but Walter makes the lion his pet instead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa20381f4e150aad251a02d4a82d1112636f7b0","amp;dn":"Secondhand+Lions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa20381f4e150aad251a02d4a82d1112636f7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,162,3,129,244,225,80,170,210,81,160,45,74,130,209,17,38,54,247,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
