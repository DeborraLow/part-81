Interestingly, while civilization has its roots in Egypt, the country has never had a democracy before, he noted, adding that pharaonic rule lasted for 3,000 years. Regarding the revolution, &quot;to me what was astounding was the amazing courage of young people&quot; who showed such persistence and tenacity after being gassed, shot at, beaten, and attacked; they remained in Cairo's Tahrir Square waving flags, and refusing to budge until they got what they wanted, he recounted. \n\nZahi Hawass, Egypt's top archaeologist, has been charged in criminal court in connection with a case brought against his ministry. On his website, he posted a decree that he will not serve any jail time. Yet, Bauval said this document was simply a receipt of his appeal process, and no final judgment has been made. He was critical of Hawass' autocratic style, and his refusal to consider any Egyptology theories that didn't mesh with his own, such as suppositions proposed by Bauval, John Anthony West, Robert Schoch, and Graham Hancock that Egypt had a much earlier chronology. \n\nHistorian Ahmed Osman, who is collaborating with Bauval for a book on Hawass, joined the conversation for a segment. He concurred that Hawass actively sought to silence all the other voices on Egyptian antiquities, angering other archaeologists (see related article from the Washington Post). Bauval talked about anomalies at Giza, including temples built with 200-ton blocks, which indicate to him they were constructed via some type of lost or unknown technology. He also reviewed findings from his recent book Black Genesis (see earlier recap). \n\nPrescription Drug Abuse\nFirst hour guest, Dr. John Abramson addressed the growing problem of prescription drug abuse (the Obama administration has just unveiled a plan to fight the epidemic). The abuse of painkillers is out of control, and it's one of the biggest health problems we've got, Abramson commented. &quot;Oxycontin really ushered in a new era of prescription drug abuse in the U.S.,&quot; with doctors convinced by marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies to write more prescriptions for this drug, he explained. And now marketing and money-making have taken precedence over people's well being, he lamented. \n\nNews segment guest: Mike Bara \n\nWebsite(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢robertbauval.co.uk\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ahmedosman.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢overdosedamerica.com\nBook(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Black Genesis: The Prehistoric Origins of Ancient Egypt\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The Egypt Code\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The Orion Mystery: Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Overdosed America\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a19cf6ec0e7292aebab250d9e20e05587fde182","amp;dn":"Coast+to+coast+AM+2011-04-19+Egypt+%26+Zahi+Hawass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a19cf6ec0e7292aebab250d9e20e05587fde182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,25,207,110,192,231,41,42,235,171,37,13,158,32,224,85,135,253,225,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
