Wounded and              \n           bleeding in a church confessional, he tells an                 \n           unsuspecting Father Wade his tragic story. At a young          \n           age, Gil's father takes him to America in search of a          \n           better life, forcing him to leave the girl he loves in         \n           Mexico. Orphaned shortly after arriving, Gil is taken in       \n           by his father's only friend, Dustin, who raises Gil along      \n           with his own son, Rod. Fifteen years later, Gil &amp; Rod          \n           have yet to find their way in life, still living at home       \n           and playing basketball on the streets for money. When          \n           cancer overtakes Dustin, they are faced with a funeral         \n           bill they cannot afford. Desperately searching for a           \n           solution, Rod suggests kidnapping for ransom. Gil knows        \n           of the perfect person: a woman married to a wealthy man        \n           who would never risk the life of his loved one for the         \n           relatively small amount of money in question. But Rod          \n           doesn't know the whole truth - the woman is Desdemona,         \n           Gil's childhood love from Mexico. The misguided brothers       \n           proceed hastily with their ill-fated plan as love,             \n           betrayal and racism collide to produce unpredictable and       \n           tragic results.                                                \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Glenn Morshower............ : ................Father Wade      \n           Jorge A.
