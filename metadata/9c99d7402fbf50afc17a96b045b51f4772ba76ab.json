Peer to Einstein and Buckminster Fuller, Jacque is a self-taught futurist who describes himself most often as a &quot;generalist&quot; or multi-disciplinarian -- a student of many inter-related fields. He is a prolific inventor, having spent his entire life (he is now 90 years old) conceiving of and devising inventions on various scales which entail the use of innovative technology. As a futurist, Jacque is not only a conceptualist and a theoretician, but he is also an engineer and a designer.\n\nNote from the uploader: This torrent includes all of the interviews and extra's.
