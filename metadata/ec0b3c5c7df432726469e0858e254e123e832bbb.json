The sound quality is much improved on this version, I forgot to turn on my phono preamp on the last version when transferring from the vinyl and the last version sounded very thin with very little bass frequency.  I highly recommend re-downloading this version if you downloaded prior to the date that this is posted.\n\nInfo\n------------------------\n\nArtist:  Designer\nTitle:   Vandal / Larson (12-inch)\nLabel:   Soul Static Sound\nRelease: Soul 15\n\nTracks:\n\n01 - Vandal (Brown Rice Mix) [4:57]\n02 - Larson (Final Phase)    [5:25]\n\nFormat:  Apple Lossless\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec0b3c5c7df432726469e0858e254e123e832bbb","amp;dn":"Designer+-+Vandal+%2F+Larson+12-inch+%28Apple+Lossless%29+%5Bupdated%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec0b3c5c7df432726469e0858e254e123e832bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,11,60,92,125,244,50,114,100,105,224,133,142,37,78,18,62,131,43,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
