O'Connor shopped it around to different labels, but none of them were interested. Frustrated, O'Connor pressed 500 copies of the single himself and released them to UK radio stations, with the studio's phone number on them, just in case major record labels contacted the stations for information about the song.\n\nHowever one Liverpool station began giving the phone number out on air and O'Connor began to receive hundreds of phone calls from the area, asking for copies of the song. By this time interest was developing rapidly, and when a major label offered to take the single, O'Connor turned them down, having already secured pressing and distribution.\n\nSimon Bates, then a BBC Radio 1 DJ, promoted the song, and it became an instant hit, spending two weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart[2] and becoming the ninth best-selling single of 1987 in the UK.\n\nThe song became well known in the U.S. due to the frequency with which it has been played on the Dr. Demento Show radio program. It appears on the Rhino Records compilation album The Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection.\n\n:::-&gt; Lyrics &lt;-:::\n\n\nStar Trekkin', across the universe\nOn the Starship Enterprise, under Captain Kirk\nStar Trekkin', across the universe\nBoldly going forward, 'cause we can't find reverse\n\nLt.
