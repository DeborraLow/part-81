This news gives him the impulse to go back out and work on his standup, something he hasn't done in years thanks to the massive success of his movie career. At a club, he meets struggling standup Ira Wright (Seth Rogen), takes a shine to him, and hires the young man both to write jokes and to be his personal assistant. Ira, who's been sleeping on a friend's pull-out couch and working a day job at a deli, enjoys the glimpse into the superstar lifestyle, but soon the protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© discovers how selfish and egocentric his mentor really is. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill, and a host of famous standup comics make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 32 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dd79dd85bdc3320c8661ce9627d4619999fc4cb","amp;dn":"Funny+People%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dd79dd85bdc3320c8661ce9627d4619999fc4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,215,157,216,91,220,51,32,200,102,28,233,98,125,70,25,153,159,196,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
