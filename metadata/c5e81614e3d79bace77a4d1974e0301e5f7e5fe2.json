The problem is that once Apple stops signing the old firmware, there is no way to get SHSH blobs for it. This is where iFaith comes in, it allows users to dump SHSH files for the old firmware running on the device even if Apple is not signing the firmware.\n\n\nAll credits goes to the developer of this application, NOT to ME.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5e81614e3d79bace77a4d1974e0301e5f7e5fe2","amp;dn":"iFaith-v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5e81614e3d79bace77a4d1974e0301e5f7e5fe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,232,22,20,227,215,155,172,231,122,77,25,116,224,48,30,95,126,95,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
