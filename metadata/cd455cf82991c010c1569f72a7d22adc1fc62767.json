The spooky artwork may look familiar because it was created by the same artist (Keef) who did the first Black Sabbath album.This album should appeal to those interested in the beginnings of heavy rock. Not as heavy or as well produced as Sabbath so I wouldn't agree with one of the reviewers below! it has a more heavy psychedelic/progressive flavor! After saying that it's well worth checking out. 20 tracks and extensive liner notes.

Legend has it that unlike the more coy Black Sabbath, Zior were serious practitioners of the black arts, for all the good it did their career.\n\nHighly collectable and exceptionally underground Hard Rock outfit. Vocalist Keith Bonser is ex-ESSEX FIVE and CARDBOARD ORCHESTRA. Peter Brewer had been a member of THE NIGHTRIDERS. Bassist Barry Skeels had once been a member of the delightfully named BUMS.\n\nZIOR's debut 1971 album, issued on the Nepentha label, drew similarities to higher profile Heavy Metal bands, not just due to the heaviness of the music but also the album cover, designed by the same studio that had shot the first BLACK SABBATH album.The same artist that Black Sabbath had used on the first album; an artist called Keef.\n\nZIOR switched to Intercord for the release of another obscure 1972's masterpiece 'Every Inch A Man' on the Global imprint. Released only in Germany this album featured an intro of pseudo-occult ramblings and the track 'Entrance Of The Devil' replete with maniacal laughter and terrified screams.\n\nThe members of ZIOR released a black magic flavoured Hard Rock album under pseudonyms as MONUMENT on the Beacon Label in 1971.\n\nThe first ZIOR album was given a re-release through the Italian Akarma label. In later years Bonzer gained notoriety by dressing up in a giant dragon suit to appear on the BBC TV series 'Jim'll Fix It'. He would also try his arm as a puppeteer and open his own nightclub in Southend.\n\nZior was a 4 piece band but on both albums the 4th member is missing on the photo, weird!\n\nThe first album came out on Nepentha records... Zior was as heavy as Black Sabbath as Budgie as early Zeppelin as Deep Purple as Uriah Heep as early Grand Funk and Cactus. &quot;Every Inch A Man&quot; is truly one of the best heavy rock album ever released, they deserved so much more... Much Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n\nReview from blog\n\nZior's 1971 debut album got immediate attention when it was released because the band used the same artist that Black Sabbath had used on their first album (an artist called Keef). This first album is a knockout of fantastic heavy rock and is still one of my favourite albums of that year.Zior had their roots in Southend's early sixties R&amp;B scene. Kevin Bonsor had previously been in a local R&amp;B outfit, The Essex Five, and then classical/rock fusion outfit, Cardboard Orchestra. Pete Brewer had been in another Southend R&amp;B band, The Night Riders. He and Bonsor were Zior's founding members recruiting Truba and Skeels (who'd once played in a London band called The Bum) via a 'Melody Maker' advert. Zior did have a reputation as a wild live band. They were heavily into Black Magic and Satanic Masses etc. They recorded an album on the Beacon label, later in 1971, which was credited to Monument,though in fact it featured all four members of Zior.\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alexgitlin.com/npp2/zior.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alexgitlin.com/npp2/zior.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAn obscure progressive/heavy rock group whose debut album has few memorable moments but has become quite collectable because of the label it's on. The pick of the batch are: 'I Really Do', 'Za Za Za Zilda' (also released as a 45), 'Love's Desire' and 'Oh Mariya', but all four were in a similar heavy rock style.\n\nThe See For Miles album reissue includes five previously unreleased tracks from a second projected album which never saw light of day. The best of these was 'Strange Kind Of Magic', which had a good voodoo beat and some distorted guitar. Overall, the songs were stronger than the material on the original album. 'Cat's Eyes' had some decent heavy rock guitar riffs.\n\nZior had their roots in Southend's early sixties R&amp;B scene.

Skeels sells dress jewellery in his native Newcastle. Bonsor worked for many years as an engineer/producer at Tin Pan Alley Studios and also became a DJ in the late 70s, hosting 'Capital's Big Night Out' at The Lyceum in London's Strand.\n\nTaken from The Tapestry of Delights - The Comprehensive Guide to British Music of the Beat, R&amp;B, Psychedelic and Progressive Eras 1963-1976, Vernon Joynson\nISBN 1 899855 04 1\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nZior - Zior\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Zior\nAlbum................: Zior\nGenre................: Progressive Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1971\nRipper...............: Exact Audio Copy (Secure mode) &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: FLAC\n\nRipped by............: cozzmick on 4/16/2011\nPosted by............: cozzmick on 5/4/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front Back CD\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
