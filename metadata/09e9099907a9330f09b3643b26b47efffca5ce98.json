bragging or anything.\n\n        In April 2009, Tom brought his debut solo show, Tom Ballard Is\n        What He Is to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival  and\n        was  the  youngest person  EVER  to take  out  the prestigious\n        Melbourne Airport Best Newcomer award. Is What He Is was  also\n        nominated for a Golden  Gibbo Award; an award  that recognizes\n        independent shows  that &quot;buck  trends and  pursue the artist's\n        ideas more strongly than it puruses any commercial lure&quot;. \n\n        Following  on from  his successes  in Melbourne,  in 2009  Tom\n        travelled overseas to perform at the Just For Laughs  festival\n        in  Montreal and  then on  to the  Edinburgh Fringe  Festival.\n        Rounding out 2009, Tom then brought a brand new stand-up  show\n        to the Melbourne Fringe  Festival.In 2010, Tom returned to the\n        Melbourne  Comedy  Festival and  visited  the Brisbane  Comedy\n        Festival for the first time with a new show, Cogito Ergo  Some\n        Funny where he played to packed houses.\n\n        Tom has been a guest on an extensive range of radio shows  all\n        around  Australia,  and can  be  seen as  a  regular guest  on\n        Network Ten's Good News Week and The 7PM Project.\n\n        In 2011,  Tom's first  DVD was  released of  his award winning\n        show Is What  He Is as  part of the  Warehouse Comedy Festival\n        series.  A 30 minute television special of this recording will\n        also be aired on ABC TV in 2011.\n\n        La-di-dah.\n\n        Tom's  mum thinks  he's quite  funny, but  wishes he  wouldn't\n        swear quite as much as he does.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                 Tom Ballard\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n       10 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e9099907a9330f09b3643b26b47efffca5ce98","amp;dn":"Tom.Ballard.Is.What.He.Is.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e9099907a9330f09b3643b26b47efffca5ce98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,233,9,153,7,169,51,15,9,179,100,59,38,180,126,255,252,165,206,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
