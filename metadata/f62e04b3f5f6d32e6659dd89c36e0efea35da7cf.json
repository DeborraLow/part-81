A vending machine fights back\n      after being kicked by a dissatisfied would-be customer, we find\n      out what action to take when being kept awake by noisy seagulls,\n      and Carlos Zumba demonstrates why his dance craze is such a hit\n      with the ladies. A local undertaker offers a surprising funeral\n      deal and Burnistoun's local MP gets caught out by online\n      technology. Finally, we go back in time to the local dance hall\n      at the time of the Second World War and see how the local girls\n      reacted when the Yanks came to Burnistoun.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
