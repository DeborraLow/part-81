In search of their own unique style\nthe band releaased three demos. Kairi's music is the\nsuperposition of deep Ambient sounds, heavy enveloping\nriffs and despair of Funeral Doom metal. The bloom of\nmelancholic symphony, clear vocals weaving with powerful\ngrowls and dark album's atmosphere reflect the soul's\njourney in the labyrinths of mind. It's the way which\nstarts now.\n\n\nSupport the artists!
