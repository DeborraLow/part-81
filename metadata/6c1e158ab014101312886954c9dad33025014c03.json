In order to put an end to a    \n         two decades' conflict, Gotti pulls together an   \n         unlikely crew made up of one member from each    \n         crime family to pull off a silver bullion        \n         heist. If Gotti can keep these criminal          \n         misfits from killing each other and succeed      \n         with this problem-riddled heist he will secure   \n         himself a spot in mafia history. This gang of    \n         misfit gangsters, hijackers and wanna-bees,      \n         all in their late 20's, hang out playing cards   \n         at a gambling den known as the &quot;Sinatra Club&quot;    \n         owned by Crazy Salvatore Polisi, the narrator    \n         of our story. At the time, nobody is getting     \n         &quot;made&quot; because all the families are at war.      \n         What's worse, the bosses have no idea who John   \n         and his underlings are. Determined to make a     \n         name for himself, John masterminds a scheme      \n         that will either squash the beef among the       \n         five families or get him and his whole crew      \n         killed...                                        \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [ ] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [*] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n          [23.976] Framerate         [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n         [624x352 ] Resolution      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n                                    [ac3@192kbps       ]               \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [ ] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [942 ] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                 Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: NOVO INSECTS VOMIT SADPANDA SPiCE SMeG         \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP NTX XPRESS THUGLiNE  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
