It's graphically tame, but the storyline is original. A minor hiding in his own home as new owners move in. It stars Dabney Coleman and Lisa Eilbacher, who went on the greater things in the entertainment industry. It also features John Larch, who portrayed Harry Callaghan's disillusioned boss in the first Dirty Harry movie.\n\nIt's in .mp4 H264 format, not .avi.\n\nAspect ratio: 4:3\n\nIt's a VHS transfer, showing analog limitations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58a765f3dffe21aca54cba1b82abb546b86c522","amp;dn":"Bad+Ronald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58a765f3dffe21aca54cba1b82abb546b86c522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,138,118,95,61,255,226,26,202,84,203,161,184,42,187,84,107,134,197,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
