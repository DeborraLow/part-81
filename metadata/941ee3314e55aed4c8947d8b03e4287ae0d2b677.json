He is one of the most\ninfluential pianist/composers to have appeared on the French scene in the last\n15 years, having explored all the possible links between jazz and rock. He has\ncollaborated with some major jazz artists, including (Michel Portal, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois\nJeanneau, Trilok Gurtu and the late Woody Shaw), but it is his work with large\norchestrasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½both at the beginning of his career in 1986 with the National Jazz\nOrchestra and, more recently, at the heart of the WDRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which gave him a taste for\nwriting on a large scale.\n\nBrimming with ideas, Emler created his Megaoctet in 1988, which has gone from\nstrength to strength ever since, picking up a host of major awards including\nDjango d'Or (1992) and the Victoires du Jazz (2005) album of the year award for\nDreams in Tune (Nocturne Jazz, 2004). He has also garnered universal praise from\nthe French press following the release of West in Peace (Nocturne, 2007), for\nwhich he was also awarded the Django d'Or and Jazz Academy prize. All this is\nproof that the Megaoctet is universally acknowledged as remarkable by those at\nthe heart of the French jazz scene.\n\nEmler has created a kind of jazz/rock opera, constructing and deconstructing his\ncompositions accordingly. The Megaoctet excels in furious unison work, visceral\nexaltations and moments of sheer calm; a passionate, loving session. This\neffervescent fusion echoes a jungle of sound that Duke Ellington and Charles\nMingus might have created with Frank Zappa, had they had the opportunity to\ncollaborate with each other. The music avoids sticking to rigid linear\nstructure, instead written by Emler as a suite of movements, as on &quot;Mail to\nElise.&quot; Solos are equally distributed amongst group membersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who sound like a big\nband despite being only a nonet. Each player marries humor and self-deprecation,\nunder the guidance of the ever-surprising cornetist Mederic Collignon or altoist\nThomas de Pourquery, who sings like a crooner. The writing is both deep and\nextremely expressive.\n\nA DVD released by Triton filmed in a little Parisian club in September 2008\nprovides a glimpse of this high energy group. Taken from many angles with some\nhot close-ups, the film demonstrates the demands of this inventive music, as it\nrevisits the spirit of Ellington and Mingus.\n\n\nAndy EMLER MEGAOCTET : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrouch, Touch, EngageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ **** (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lesdnj.com/article-34621533.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lesdnj.com/article-34621533.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nANDY EMLER MEGAOCTET ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCROUCH, TOUCH, ENGAGEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distritojazz.blogspot.com/2009/10/andy-emler-megaoctet-crouch-touch.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distritojazz.blogspot.com/2009/10/andy-emler-megaoctet-crouch-touch.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941ee3314e55aed4c8947d8b03e4287ae0d2b677","amp;dn":"Andy+Emler+Megaoctet+-+Crouch%2C+Touch%2C+Engage+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941ee3314e55aed4c8947d8b03e4287ae0d2b677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,30,227,49,78,85,174,212,200,148,125,139,3,228,40,122,224,210,182,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
