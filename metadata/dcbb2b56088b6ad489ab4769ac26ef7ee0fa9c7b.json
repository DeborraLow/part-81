Their work is derived from the teachings of &quot;Non-Physical Source Energy&quot; whom they refer to as &quot;Abraham&quot;.\n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.\n\n&quot;The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.&quot;\n\nAnswers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham - whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\n\nThank you to all who participated to make this possible!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbb2b56088b6ad489ab4769ac26ef7ee0fa9c7b","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2010-08-21+San+Diego%2C+CA+4CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcbb2b56088b6ad489ab4769ac26ef7ee0fa9c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,187,43,86,8,139,106,212,137,171,71,105,172,38,239,126,224,250,156,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
