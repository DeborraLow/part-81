Rob was reeling\nfrom the loss of his biggest supporter and\ninspiration, his mother, and Nikki was coping with\nthe exodus of all of her closest friends and loved\nones to the west coast while remaining in Boston to\npursue musical endeavors. Both were toiling away in\nthe Boston music and comedy scenes, respectively, and\nwere starting to feel a little weathered. Though they\nhad crossed paths numerous times before without so\nmuch as a passing greeting, late one night at a party\nat New Alliance Studios, they found themselves on the\nsame old couch seeking respite from the noise and\nnetworking. It all started when Rob asked Nikki, &quot;Why\ndo you play music?&quot; and the outpouring of emotions\nand truth from the two of them that followed. They\nspent the next 6 months finding that they were\nseeking much the same thing...a return to the\nchildlike love of music and life, but with undertones\nof the pain and realism of both their individual\nlives. From beach drives to bowling, personal\nphilosophy and later to fun-loving videos, they were\nfast writing a script that would turn into a\nsimplistic yet cuttingly honest debut album of 20\nsongs and 3 bedroom demos within a 2 month time span.\n&quot;Did We Happen to Begin?&quot;* the debut album from Super\nTime Pilot is the culmination of the collision of two\npeople burning at an alarming rate and refusing to\nfit into any predetermined definitions. With only 2\ndays to do it in and the help of 4 great friends and\nBoston contemporaries, Nate (drums), Kier (guitar),\nAdam (bass), and Kevin (sax), it seemed magic had\nbeen on their side. Bouncing from humor to heart to\npsychology and back to explosive laughter, Rob and\nNikki sought to lay their insides out on this album\nand have a blast doing it. &quot;Did we happen to begin?&quot;\nis the question you ask a whirlwind of a person who\nunwittingly helps you find your own perspective\nagain. Here we have two people asking each other the\nsame question. *Super Time Pilot debut album &quot;Did We\nHappen to Begin?&quot; due out in the Fall of 2009, on\nOpen E Records\n\niNTERRUPTING THE SILENCE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58e0b56100db078c7d3ba0f0a4af28c9bef7b35","amp;dn":"Super+Time+Pilot-Did+We+Happen+gin-2009-iTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58e0b56100db078c7d3ba0f0a4af28c9bef7b35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,142,11,86,16,13,176,120,199,211,186,15,10,74,242,140,155,239,123,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
