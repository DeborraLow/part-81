Black Sleep Of KaliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal is to play heavy music that still retains melody, with a focus on getting awesome guitar tone from vintage amplifiers. In winter 2008 BSOK recorded a 5 song EP with Andy Paterson (Eagle Twin, Gaza, Ascend) which was independently released on Aug 1 2009.  As of January 2010 Black Sleep of Kali singed to Small Stone Records out of Detroit and are going back into the studio again with Andy Paterson in March 2010 to record their Small Stone records debut.
