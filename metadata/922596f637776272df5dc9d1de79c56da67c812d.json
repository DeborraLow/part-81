It was one of \ntwo episodes delayed even though it is fortunately \nnot a holiday story.\n\nEve Plumb played Susan Oliver's little girl Kathy. \nTwo years later she became famous as Jan Brady on The Brady Bunch.\n\nIt's possible that Charles Bickford was still alive \nwhen this was made.......he just wasn't in this episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922596f637776272df5dc9d1de79c56da67c812d","amp;dn":"THE+VIRGINIAN+--+A+Small+Taste+of+Justice+%28+early+6th+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922596f637776272df5dc9d1de79c56da67c812d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,37,150,246,55,119,98,114,223,93,201,209,222,121,197,109,166,124,129,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
