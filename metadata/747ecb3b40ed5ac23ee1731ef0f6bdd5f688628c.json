The Vanishing of Katharina Linden is an unforgettable debut - at once chilling and endearing, haunting and richly insightful - the story of one girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big heart and even bigger imagination, and of a world full of mystery, good, and evil.\n\nIt isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ten-year-old PiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fault that her grandmother dies in a freak accident. But tell that to the citizens of PiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s little German hometown of Bad MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nstereifel, or to the classmates who shun her. The only one who still wants to be her friend is StinkStefan, the most unpopular child in school.\n\nBut then something else captures the communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention: the vanishing of Katharina Linden. Katharina was last seen on a float in a parade, dressed as Snow White. Then, like a character in a GrimmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fairy tale, she disappears. But, this being real life, she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t return.\n\nPia and Stefan suspect that Katharina has been spirited away by the supernatural. Their investigation is inspired by the instructive - and cautionary - local legends told to them by their elderly friend Herr Schiller, tales such as that of Unshockable Hans, visited by witches in the form of cats, or of the knight whose son is doomed to hunt forever.\n\nThen another girl disappears, and Pia is plunged into a new and unnerving place, one far away from fairy tales - and perilously close to adulthood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:747ecb3b40ed5ac23ee1731ef0f6bdd5f688628c","amp;dn":"Helen+Grant+-+The+Vanishing+Of+Katharina+Linden%3A+A+Novel+%28Unabri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"747ecb3b40ed5ac23ee1731ef0f6bdd5f688628c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,126,203,59,64,237,90,194,62,225,115,30,240,246,189,213,246,136,98,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
