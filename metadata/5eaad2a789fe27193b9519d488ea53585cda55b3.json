Enter the role of the 18th century commander who's on a mission to obliterate evil, by fighting your way through the island of El Mirando. A mystic plague has consumed the inhabitants of this island and you'll have to liberate their souls by sword, and travel deep into the island to find and stop the dark minds behind the cursed disease. You'll have to act, think and move fast if you want to survive the horrors of these wicked parts of the world. And do not hope for any rescue or help, it's all up to you and you alone!\n\n\nseed comment n enjoy!!!...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eaad2a789fe27193b9519d488ea53585cda55b3","amp;dn":"Dead+Meets+Lead+%5BEnglish%5D%5Bsneak_shot%5D%5BPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eaad2a789fe27193b9519d488ea53585cda55b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,170,210,167,137,254,39,25,59,149,25,212,136,234,83,88,92,218,85,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
