This most vibrant personality\\\\\\'s letters are rich in theology as well as practical exhortation, dealing with our living hope, suffering persecution for righteousness\\\\\\' sake, the use of heavenly gifts, patience in suffering, fidelity in service, and humility in ministering to one another.\n\nPeter\\\\\\'s letters also have a clear eschatonogical orientation, focusing on the Lord\\\\\\'s coming and the end of the world, with warnings against false teachers-foreseeing the apostasy in which the professing church will end.\n\nWritten by one of the most colorful personalities who participated in the greatest adventures of human history, a careful study of these letters is a certain treat to the diligent student.\n\nIncludes MP3 files.\n\nThe 1 and 2 Peter Commentary includes the following studies on four DVDs:\n\n   * 1 Peter Session 1- Introduction. Life of Peter. Peter\\\\\\'s Confession\n   * 1 Peter Session 2- Five Specific Exhortations. Divine Election. The Most Painful Sin.\n   * 1 Peter Session 3-Christ, the Rock. Royal Priesthood.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\\\\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n\\\\\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
