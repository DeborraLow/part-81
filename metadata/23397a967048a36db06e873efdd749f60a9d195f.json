First published by Comico, Wagner has now moved his character to Dark Horse. Originally a noir comic in the style of European titles such as Diabolik, it has evolved into, in Wagner's words, a study of the nature of aggression. In 2009, Hunter Rose, the first Grendel, was ranked as IGN's 88th Greatest Villain of All Time.\n\nFor more info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(comics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(comics)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23397a967048a36db06e873efdd749f60a9d195f","amp;dn":"Grendel+complete+as+of+07-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23397a967048a36db06e873efdd749f60a9d195f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,57,122,150,112,72,163,109,176,110,135,62,253,215,73,246,10,157,25,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
