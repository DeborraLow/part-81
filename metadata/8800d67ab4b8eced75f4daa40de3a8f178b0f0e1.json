Sinead OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor, fellow Manc legends Andy Rourke and Paul Ryder, plus ex-Pistols Steve Cook and Paul Jones all make guest appearances. ManchesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s answer to Bob Marley even invited Paul McCartney to join his rock-god love-in, but it seems the former Beatle declined. Doh! Some people.\n\nLess impressive, alas, are the lyrical platitudes and flat-footed arrangements which pepper 'The World Is Yours'. After flirting with electro beats, cosmic funk and millennial reggae on previous albums, Brown settles for a fairly conservative mix of choppy guitars and programmed strings here. Strident midtempo rockers dominate, but melodic grace and lyrical epiphanies are in short supply.\n\nBrown has always aspired to sage-like profundity and quasi-Biblical import, but generally filtered through an intoxicating fog of stoner mysticism. Here he pushes the Yoda-like proclamations to the point of banal self-parody: one law for the rich and another for the poor, you get what you give, homeless kids just need love - and so on, 'ad infinitum'.\n\nOn the apocalyptic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave UsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he admonishes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthose whose eyes are closed to the plight of the African childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIllegal AttacksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he and Sinead condemn the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcommercial crusadesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Iraq and Afghanistan with images of weeping mothers. Worthy and sincere sentiments, no doubt, but so baldly expressed they could be Phil Collins lyrics.\n\nFortunately, for all his Christ-like posturing, Brown remains better at menace and malevolence than messianic empathy. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSister RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, with feverish funk-rock backing from Cook and Jones, he summons a vengeful feminist goddess. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSome Folks Are HollowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he skewers church hypocrisy with exhilarating spite. Likewise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodbye To The BrokenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, where he emphatically severs ties with an ex-lover (or possibly former band mate?) over lush, weeping strings. More memorable for famous guests than fine tunes, 'The World Is Yours' does not diminish BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reputation, but it lacks the exotic, adventurous reach of his best\nwork. Hobbled by half-realised potential, BritrockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s would-be saviour remains a rough beast, slouching towards Bethlehem to be born.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8800d67ab4b8eced75f4daa40de3a8f178b0f0e1","amp;dn":"Ian+Brown...The+World+Is+Yours%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8800d67ab4b8eced75f4daa40de3a8f178b0f0e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,0,214,122,180,184,236,237,117,244,218,164,13,227,168,241,120,176,240,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
