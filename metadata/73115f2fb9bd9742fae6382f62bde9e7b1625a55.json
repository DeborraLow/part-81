Lose everything. Get a tattoo, get a facelift, get a new direction, get a book deal about recovery, and get Jesus. Be welcomed back as a role model.\nTexas blues troubadour Hadden Sayers didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t follow the usual script. His tribulations werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the result of personal demons. He didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t call on a team of slick advisors and publicists to resuscitate his career. He didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look for reality shows, sex tapes, or reunion tours to make an easy buck. Hadden Sayers knew that sometimes an honest dollar is a hard dollar.\nBlues power guitarist Hadden Sayers has bent more strings to earn a Hard Dollar than most and his music proves it. Tough to the point of indestructible, yet pliant and vulnerable when required, it is the story of a man who has hit lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roadblocks head on and emerged unbowed and unbroken. Best of all, like all great art that tells the truth, it could be everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story. With his road-tested combo of Tony McClung (drums), Mark Frye (bass, Fender Rhodes) and Dave DeWitt (Hammond B-3, Wurlitzer and piano) sharp as mesquite cactus, Sayers has penned 13 numbers guaranteed to bring his career good luck.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
