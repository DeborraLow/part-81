Forman is able to distil universal truths from the simplest of situations and present them with a sharp yet compassionate eye.\nA Blonde in Love remains a tender and beautifully observed story about the seemingly impossible odds of young romance and youthful aspiration under totalitarianism.\n\n\n&quot;If I had to pick just one film, it would be A Blonde in Love&quot; \nKen Loach, Movie Heaven - The Guardian    \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA small gem... indescribably exact, touching and funnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nTom Milne, Time Out Film Guide\n\n&quot;A keystone of the Czech New Wave... political bite, deft humour and a warm but unblinkered view of humanity&quot;\nPhilip Kemp, Total Film\n\n=================================\n\nto play the english subtitles open VLC player - Video - Subtitle track - English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324b8a0eef46916326d930d5c5cbcb4b9e032e23","amp;dn":"A+Blonde+in+Love+%281965%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324b8a0eef46916326d930d5c5cbcb4b9e032e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,75,138,14,239,70,145,99,38,217,48,213,197,203,203,75,158,3,46,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
