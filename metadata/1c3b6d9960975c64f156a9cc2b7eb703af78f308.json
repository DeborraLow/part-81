And came up with .. THE VERY BEST PUNK ROCK SONGS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦EVER   I know this is going to cause controversy , especially among the guys from the U.S.  Cause this is mainly the British groups from late 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to early eighties .ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just my personal favourites . I made a front and back cover for it , find it in the folder. They are all ready to burn to cd .  Steevo-be-thy-name . Enjoy.\n            ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3b6d9960975c64f156a9cc2b7eb703af78f308","amp;dn":"THE+VERY+BEST+PUNK+ROCK+SONGS+...+EVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3b6d9960975c64f156a9cc2b7eb703af78f308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,59,109,153,96,151,92,100,241,86,169,204,43,126,183,3,175,120,243,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
