Amazing, Extraordinary, Priceless...\n\nRussell Peters is one of the funniest comedians of the new millennium. is this a stupid question or what? Russell Peters played to 15,000 people at the Air Canada Centre and he\\'ll play to 15,000 more many more times so is there anyone else in comedy right now who could sell 30,000 tickets? maybe one other person, right? No i don\\'t think so. Prove me wrong?\n\nRussell Peters stand up comedy is its own kind, full of laugh after laugh. I never liked stand up but oh my, Russell Peters takes it to another level with his ability to mimic many accents of South Asian, Chinese, Persian, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, American, Jamaican and Canadian accents really have to be heard to be believed. He has the body language and facial expressions of his targets down pat this is a man who can gesture in other languages. We found ourselves pinching one leg to keep from laughing over any of Peters incisive observations about humanity.\n\nHis racial jokes are things you have never heard before, they truly are funniest and truest things you will ever hear. He runs through a dozen distinguishing ethnic characteristics, how Italians insult people by calling them vegetable names, how Indian people pose for photos, how Indians and Armenians are hairy, how South Americans pronounce their country names, who can\\'t drink, who gets loud, why Arabs look so fierce on TV. He mocks anyone and everyone, and no one is exempt. One of the funniest segments in his show is a send up of the blind, the deaf and the halt and everyone else with any sort of handicap. You laugh in spite of yourself.\n\nThis review cant explain how funny Russell Peters is you have too see it to believe it and i guarantee you will agree with me. Russell Peters is one of the few true comedians we have left and he will make you laugh until your stomach begs you to stop. Red White &amp; Brown is a must see!! \n\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY! \n\nIf you would like to live chat or instant message me, here is one of my many contacts -  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7819161f1d14111b1c1d1517164e413810170c15191114561b17560d13&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
