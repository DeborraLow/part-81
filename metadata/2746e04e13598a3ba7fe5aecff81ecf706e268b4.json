Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter playing in rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will HuntingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1998.\n\nSmith suffered from depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was posthumously released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n\n\n1995\n\nElliott Smith live at Botttom Of The Hill esmith1995-03-06.flacf.zip338,97MB\nElliott Smith live at Club Congo esmith1995-12-xx.flac.zip309,96MB\nElliott Smith live at ultrasound esmith1995-03-31.flac.zip108,45MB\n\n\n1996\n\nElliott Smith live at Neal House Columbus, Ohio esmith1996-03-06.aud.flac16.zip\nElliott Smith live at westbeth theatre esmith1996-03-30.flac.zip 189,35MB\n\n\n2000\n\nElliott Smith live at Breakroom esmith2000-02-28.flac.zip472,76MB\nElliott Smith live at The Ritz esmith2000-05-10.zip343,74MB\nElliott Smith live at L'Olympic on 2000-09-28.zip98,90MB\n\n\n2001\n\nElliott Smith live at Great American Music Hall on 2001-12-17.zip\nElliott Smith live at silverlake lounge esmith2001-02-06flac.zip177,55MB\nElliott Smith live at The Wiltern esmith2001-11-09.flac.zip176,59MB\nElliott Smith live at Crystal Ballroom on 2001-12-20 .zip656,00MB\n\n\n2003\n\nElliott Smith live at Belly Up Tavern esmith2003-05-22.flacf.zip488,83MB\nElliott Smith live at Redfest esmith2003-09-19.flac.zip429,23MB\nElliott Smith Live at The Derby on 2003-05-2831,30MB\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext part will be uploaded after this one (and previous ones) are uploaded and fully seeded!!\nSo, it is up to you seeders &amp; leechers to decide if more will follow indeed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAND AS ALWAYS: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\n\nI KNOW IT'S A BIG ONE, BUT IT'S ALSO THE ONLY TORRENT PRESENTING ALL THE LIVE SHOWS!!!\n\nCOMMENTS ARE WELCOME.
