On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note: &quot;I know what you did last summer.&quot; The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max (Johnny Galecki), but then Max is murdered -- and the terror begins. (In the original Lois Duncan novel, the teens hit a small boy on a bicycle instead of a fisherman.) The screenplay is by Kevin Williamson, whose credits include the 1996 box-office hit Scream. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 41 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:068b97314dbc71d720bd887acfa4326e2e15e6ad","amp;dn":"I+Still+Know+What+You+Did+Last+Summer%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"068b97314dbc71d720bd887acfa4326e2e15e6ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,139,151,49,77,188,113,215,32,189,136,122,207,164,50,110,46,21,230,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
