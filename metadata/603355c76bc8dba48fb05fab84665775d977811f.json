This DVD just arrived in todays mail - new!\n\nIts an interesting thriller starring the likes of no less than Mr. Michael Caine\nand Sir Laurence Olivier would you believe!\n\n\nWe have included English SRT captioned subtitles that can be used as a template\nfor other languages using google convert too perhaps - in any event this is the \nPAL version so there should be a nice selection for all as I hope to see - soon!\n\nWe will soon have a second supplementary ISP hooked up for our seeding maintenance\nas our present ISP is three times the normal rate for the first 300GB of use \nand then fully one whole dollar for each gig beyond 300GB - with no cap limit\nSo I suppose we could just get into several hundreds of dollars a month if we arent\ncareful. They do provide up to 8 times the upload speed of the competition though\nand fairly reliable service too - although we have seen an outage now and then\nfor brief periods only - thank goodness! Its still the best in town - all things considered and we have asked them to look into saner rate structure so no one goes bankrupt paying for excessive service fees on their accounts.\n\nThanks for helping us to seed \n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\nBy the way, could someone fix it so we could edit our torrent postings for\nspelling errors etc. thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603355c76bc8dba48fb05fab84665775d977811f","amp;dn":"Sleuth+%281972%29+PAL+DVD+to+DivX+convert+-+moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603355c76bc8dba48fb05fab84665775d977811f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,51,85,199,107,200,219,164,143,176,95,171,132,102,87,117,217,119,129,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
