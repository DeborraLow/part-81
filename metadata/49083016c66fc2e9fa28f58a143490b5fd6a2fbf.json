These trips have yielded remarkable photos of a boundless, desolate yet beautiful environment where sky, water and land merge. Made in collaboration with documentary filmmaker Michael Angus, SALT is the film extension of FredericksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work at Lake Eyre, interweaving his photos and video diary with time-lapse sequences to create the liberating and disorienting experience of being thrown into an infinite dimension of mind and spirit. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 553 MiB for 56mn 38s 184ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 223 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 356 (1.798) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49083016c66fc2e9fa28f58a143490b5fd6a2fbf","amp;dn":"POV.S23E08.Salt.HDTV.DivX-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49083016c66fc2e9fa28f58a143490b5fd6a2fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,8,48,22,198,111,194,233,250,40,245,138,20,52,144,181,253,106,47,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
