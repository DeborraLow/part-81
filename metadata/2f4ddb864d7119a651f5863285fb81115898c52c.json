Guns NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses took to the Main stage late, but delivered a bombastic run through their greatest hits and numbers from their Chinese Democracy album. The performance featured much loved favourites including Welcome to the Jungle, Mr. Brownstone, ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s So Easy and November Rain and no small amount of pyrotechnics.\n\nHaving come onstage over an hour late, it was unlikely the band would complete an epic 25 track set list. At midnight, event organisers were forced to invoke a Council-imposed curfew, which prompted complaints from Axl Rose and threats of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s non-appearance at the Leeds festival the following night. Guns ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N Roses headline performance ended in the bizarre sight of the band staging a sit-down protest while drummer Frank Ferrer repeatedly played the intro to Paradise City and Axl wielded a megaphone. A compelling spectacle from one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most controversial rocks bands\n\nSetlist:\n\n1. Welcome to the Jungle\n2. This I Love\n3. Streets of Love\n4. November Rain\n\n\nSource: BBC iPlayer\nVideo Format: .FLV (Play with VLC or WMP Classic)\nAudio: 2ch stereo\nSize: 154MB\nLength: 26:26","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4ddb864d7119a651f5863285fb81115898c52c","amp;dn":"Guns+%5C%27n%5C%27+Roses+-+Reading+%26+Leeds+Festival+2010+%5BDeZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4ddb864d7119a651f5863285fb81115898c52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,77,219,134,77,113,25,166,81,245,134,50,133,251,129,17,88,152,197,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
