Nikita was eventually betrayed by the only people she thought she could trust. Now, after three years in hiding, Nikita is seeking retribution and making it clear to her former boss, Percy and her former friends Michael and Birkhoff that she will stop at nothing to expose and destroy their covert operation. Division continues to recruit and train other young people, among them Jaden and Thom, erasing all evidence of their former lives and turning them into cold and efficient killers. One of these new recruits, Alex is a beautiful girl with a violent past and a story not so different from Nikita\\\\\\'s. The recruits all spend part of their training with Amanda, a master manipulator who can turn any ugly duckling into a swan and any bleeding heart into a killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19357a21e341d63e93e456b3af37c85e45f0bf90","amp;dn":"Nikita+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19357a21e341d63e93e456b3af37c85e45f0bf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,53,122,33,227,65,214,62,147,228,86,179,175,55,200,94,69,240,191,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
