With Memphis, Magic Kids have crafted a heartfelt record that lives up to this tradition of iconoclastic, joyful music-making. Fragments of sounds are taken from memories of influences, the sounds that stuck since childhood and which they treat with reverence. Recorded at Doug Easley's studio by Shane Stonebeck (Vampire Weekend, Sleigh Bells) the album utilizes a array of musicians and friends playing oboes, strings, horns, 808's and synths. The resulting sound is a handcrafted take on the way great orchestrators like Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, and Jeff Lynne could take the smallest piece of pop sincerity and translate it into a song bursting with life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74ecf375f26df31e3b44ce9f92e4d58f5d1d1a50","amp;dn":"Magic+Kids+-+Memphis+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74ecf375f26df31e3b44ce9f92e4d58f5d1d1a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,236,243,117,242,109,243,30,59,68,206,159,146,228,213,143,93,29,26,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
