The pilot episode aired in the United States on Fox on February 6, 2005, thirty minutes after the end of Super Bowl XXXIX; the regular series began May 1, 2005, after the season premiere of Family Guy. American Dad! follows the events of CIA agent Stan Smith and his family. Unlike Family Guy, American Dad! does not contain cutaway gags, instead using situational humour and non sequiturs.\n\nThe series has completed its fifth season, which premiered on September 27, 2009 and ended on May 16, 2010. It has been officially renewed for a sixth season. Which I hope to upload too when it\\'s shown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ada7d89a76113fcfd8660b0758b7a95a94b6231","amp;dn":"American+Dad+Seasons+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ada7d89a76113fcfd8660b0758b7a95a94b6231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,218,125,137,167,97,19,252,253,134,96,176,117,139,122,149,169,75,98,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
