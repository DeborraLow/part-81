Simply print a PDF file, cut it out, stick it together, and stand it on a table or window ledge. When you move around, the head seems to follow you around the room. The effect is really uncanny.\n\nExample video of the dragon illusion:\n\nHow does it work? If we move around when viewing a solid object, our brain knows how the object we are looking at should behave. However the dragon gives us the wrong clues, because we mis-interpret what its shape is. We assume that the nose of the dragon is pointing out towards us, but in fact the dragons head is concave.\n\n\nIllusion List:\n\nBrain-Busters Dragon, Cat Illusion, Chucky, Chun-Li, Coati Studio, Dog Trick Academy, Dragon (3 colours), FrankenPaper, Froggie, Iron Man, Japanese Girl (2), Joker, K-9 (Doctor Who), Moving Sculpture, Robocop, Spider Man, Storm Trooper, Super Robot Dog (+ blank), Trick_Art, Vega and Yoda\n\n\nTip: If you are standing close by, try closing one eye and move around.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2748fc2538edd8b010945d118a306e0d75afd10","amp;dn":"25+Hollow-Face+illusions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2748fc2538edd8b010945d118a306e0d75afd10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,116,143,194,83,142,221,139,1,9,69,209,24,163,6,224,215,90,253,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
