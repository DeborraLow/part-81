Choose the ones that suit your needs and use them through step-by-step instructions. Most of the recipes are code-free, but a number of the recipes contain code snippets. This book is primarily written for Drupal site builders, administrators, and themers who want to develop custom content displays using Views. It can be used by anyone who has a Drupal 5 web site, including original site developers as well as people who have inherited a Drupal 5 site. Some knowledge of HTML and CSS is required; PHP basics will be handy for some of the recipes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6afcb6ca5551466b9830862fc2f4b1d60d5c01","amp;dn":"Drupal+5+Views+Recipes+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6afcb6ca5551466b9830862fc2f4b1d60d5c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,106,252,182,202,85,81,70,107,152,48,134,47,194,244,177,214,13,92,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
