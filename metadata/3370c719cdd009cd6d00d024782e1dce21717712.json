Thanks m8ty\nAUDIO:Green Lantern p2p ...........Thanks m8ty\n\n[color=red]NOTES:[/color]\n\nIMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Green Lantern 2011 \n\nOk we were going to hold fire until we got the line audio,but considering we're 100% sure when we will \nhave it,we decided to release this for the time being.\nHope to get line this week so .....until then.\n\nRight video,we were kindly given the source files which were ok but need alot of TLC.The video was filmed at\nangle and the borders all round were all slanted etc....the video was washed out and was badly interlaced.\nAlso contain 5 lines of subs which were hardcoded in russian.\nNow work done....first thing was pull the video level and change the perspective,which left us a video with pretty\nmuch straight borders which then were cropped and then resized the video to give it a better AR.\nAfter than we deinterlaced and it still had some faint line in parts so we had to recall it and blend aswell to remove all.\nThen we did our normal stuff of tweaking the rgb colours,chroma,brightness,contrast,sharpness etc...\nAnd finally we made a subpack for the non english subs and hardcoded them in yellow.\n\nAudio we had to use the p2p release as only english audio out at the time of making this.So that needed resyncing to the video\nand then cleaning up,in which we used a light noise filter and changed all the EQ on it.\n\nOverall not too bad for a cam at all and more than watchable.....all being well TS will be released soon and we'll also add the after credit\nscene then to it (as we forgot this time oops ).\n\nEnjoy folks :)\n\n\n[color=red]SCREENS:[/color]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3370c719cdd009cd6d00d024782e1dce21717712","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+2011+CAM+XViD-IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3370c719cdd009cd6d00d024782e1dce21717712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,112,199,25,205,208,9,205,109,0,208,36,120,46,29,206,33,113,119,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
