Well thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one way to make those ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIce Road TruckersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and crab fishermen look like wusses. The show is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBomb Patrol: Afghanistan.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I guess it sounds better than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Enlisted for the College Tuition, Get Me Out of Here!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The show will be on the G4 Network. The problem of course is that this could easily be handled in a tasteless and exploitative manner, or as TV networks call it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbusiness as usual.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The first indications from the G4 Network donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look good. Their promo material stresses that the soldiersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ patrols ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcould put an EOD tech wearing a 70-pound protective bomb suit in direct contact with a potentially deadly IED.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At least theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not calling the show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurvivor: Kandahar.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The problem is that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re teasing it with the possibility that some of those involved may not survive. This is an abomination. Why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t they just call this show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPimp My MilitaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? Besides, if I want to see an explosion on reality TV, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just watch Teresa on The Real Housewives of New Jersey.\n\nReality can be ugly, especially when it involves Glenn Beck. This weekend is Glenn BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRestoring HonorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rally. Glenn Beck restoring honor? ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like using Mel Gibson to restore civility. Beck is taking over the Lincoln Memorial on the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have a dreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ speech there. If Martin Luther King were still around, this would make him wake up screaming. The rally headliners are Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kind of like a Woodstock for conservatives, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure this one will feature a lot more mud. As far as IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m concerned, the mere presence of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin at the Lincoln Memorial qualifies as vandalism to a national monument.  Glenn Beck says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe will reclaim the civil rights movementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Reclaim? I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know conservatives claimed it in the first place. Is that what you were doing with the water cannons and police dogs? Glenn Beck is completely rewriting history for the sake of a bunch of old peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the kind of people who didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like that history back when they were forced to live it. These are people who spent their lives hating the legacy of the Civil Rights movement. Now Glenn Beck is telling them they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to hate itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they can co-opt and distort it. The bottom line is clear: Glenn Beck comes not to praise the Civil Rights movement, but to bury it.
