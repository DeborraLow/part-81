Farrell, Jerome Corsi, Richard C. Hoagland \nRenowned researcher with a PhD from Oxford University, Joseph P. Farrell presented evidence for a hidden history of mankind that involved tyrannical giants and an elite race bent on genetic mutation. The Greeks, Hopi, Mayans, Iroquois, Aztecs, and the Bible all recorded an ancient war against giants in the dim past. &quot;I was astounded at the parallels between all these very, very divergent cultures,&quot;-- there seems to be some kind of worldwide or civil war against the giants, for different reasons including their sexual practices and/or cannibalism. This &quot;cosmic war&quot; may have involved something far more destructive than nuclear bombs-- torsion or scalar-based weapons that effectively annihilated both sides, he said. \n\nFarrell cited ancient cuneiform tablets that suggest some type of genetic manipulation took place in which prototypical Earth females and Annunaki-type males were mixed to form modern humans, to serve as a slave race. This is particularly problematic, as our &quot;cousins&quot; may return one day to claim us as their property, he warned. Such ancient genetic engineering also produced chimerical beings composed of various human and animal components, he continued. \n\nWe're looking at the activity of one elite group, if not more, &quot;that has been in continual existence more or less since ancient times,&quot; and their behavior is to try and preserve knowledge just for themselves, he said, adding that their activity is masked by religion, mystery schools, and temples. Farrell announced his forthcoming book The Grid of the Gods which deals with the aftermath of the cosmic war, and the physics of the &quot;pyramid people.&quot; Richard C. Hoagland joined the conversation for a segment in the third hour. \n\nObama &amp; Abioitc Oil\nFirst hour guest, author Jerome Corsi talked about his forthcoming book, Where's the Birth Certificate? Though he couldn't reveal specifics ahead of its publication date in May, he implied that he's found evidence that Obama is not eligible to be President. Corsi also spoke out in favor of the abioitc oil theory--i.e. that oil is formed deep inside the Earth, but not from bio decay. \n\nNews segment guests: Jim Berkland, Douglas Hagmann \n\nWebsite(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢gizadeathstar.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢gilfordsecurities.com\nBook(s): \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Roswell and the Reich: The Nazi Connection\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Babylon's Banksters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Black Gold Stranglehold","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f14516ca756696e07a02dda0ecd2837c9c8fa5","amp;dn":"Coast+to+coast+AM+2011-04-20+Ancient+Giants+%26+Cosmic+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f14516ca756696e07a02dda0ecd2837c9c8fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,241,69,22,202,117,102,150,224,122,2,221,160,236,210,131,124,156,143,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
