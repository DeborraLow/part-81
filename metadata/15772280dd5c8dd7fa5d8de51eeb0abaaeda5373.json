We'l travel to NASA's tool lab\n              and see the equipment we need to build in this\n              challenging environment, from high tech wrenches and\n              hammers to the ultimate robotic handyman, Robonaut.\n     NOTES:\n              Hybrid. We elected to do this at 30fps to minimize\n              jerkiness and not to blend the film parts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15772280dd5c8dd7fa5d8de51eeb0abaaeda5373","amp;dn":"Known.Universe.S03E06.Construction.Zone.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15772280dd5c8dd7fa5d8de51eeb0abaaeda5373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,119,34,128,221,92,141,215,250,93,141,229,30,235,10,186,174,218,83,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
