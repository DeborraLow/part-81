Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech  --  High Speed Server\n\nPOtHS - Chuck Missler - The Prophets of The Southern Kingdom\n\nProphets to the Southern Kingdom is Chuck\\\\\\'s commentary on the books of Joel, Micah, Zephaniah, and Habakkuk.\n\nThe Prophets to the Southern Kingdom spoke many promises of Israel\\\\\\'s return to the land, Christ\\\\\\'s second coming and the overall time line from Babylon all the way through the Millennium. In a time of great turmoil, these men focused on the hope of the coming Messiah and His Kingdom. The book of Joel is a neglected book among Bible scholars. It\\\\\\'s an important book because it records Israel\\\\\\'s place in God\\\\\\'s program: from Babylon all the way through the Millennium. Micah\\\\\\'s message was heeded, repentance followed, and disaster was postponed for a century. Here was a prophet that changed history! One man can make a difference. Both Zephaniah and Jeremiah prophesied to a politically prospering people of coming judgment. Habakkuk means to embrace. Habakkuk\\\\\\'s main theme is God\\\\\\'s consistency with Himself in view of permitted evil. Why do bad things happen to good people? Habakkuk is among the last of the minor prophets to preach in Judah before the Babylonian captivity.\n\nThese DVD\\\\\\'s includes notes in PDF format and MP3 files.\n\nEncoding: ( Very Happy ) :Divx\nFormat: Color, Fullscreen\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nAudio Encoding: Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo\nRun Time: 13 hour(s)\nNumber of discs:7\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\\\\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n\\\\\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
