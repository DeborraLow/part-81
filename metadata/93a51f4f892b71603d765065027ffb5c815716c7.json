Your cell phone isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t getting service. All you have on hand are a gum wrapper and a wire hanger.\nOr maybe youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re living in a building without central air conditioning in July. You canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t afford an AC; all you have access to are a fan and a bucket of water.\n\nIn such times of desperation, many have called upon the symbol of all that is inventive, the hero who awed thousands with his cool, quick wit: What would MacGyver do? they ask..\n\nFor anyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever wished they could channel the 1980s action-adventure icon comes this clever collection of forty-five true stories, commemorating the use of improvised genius to solve everyday problems. Inspired by televisionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Angus MacGyver (played by Richard Dean Anderson), a secret agent who relied on his brains and scientific prowessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not to mention duct tape and a Swiss Army knifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to save the day, the &quot;MacGyverisms&quot; recounted range from the concrete (using Chex Mix to provide traction in an icy parking lot) to the intangible (saving a relationship with the perfect turn of phrase). Edgy, entertaining, and smirk-to-yourself funny, these masterfully told stories reveal that, with a little luck and a lot of ingenuity, you can &quot;MacGyver&quot; yourself out of virtually any predicament.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93a51f4f892b71603d765065027ffb5c815716c7","amp;dn":"What+Would+McGyver+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93a51f4f892b71603d765065027ffb5c815716c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,165,31,79,137,43,113,96,61,118,80,101,2,127,251,92,129,87,22,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
