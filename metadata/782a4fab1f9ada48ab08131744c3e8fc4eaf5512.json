It was released on March 11, 1983, bolstered by the #5 hit &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; and the #31 hit &quot;Metal Health&quot;. It knocked The Police's Synchronicity out of #1 in the U.S. The album went on to sell more than 6 million copies and it is considered a classic among heavy metal fans to this day. However, some critics such as Allmusic [1], perceive it as a one-hit wonder, owing to Quiet Riot's relative lack of critical and commercial success with following albums (and subsequent disintegration) towards the end of the 1980s. The title track was ranked #35 on Vh1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.\n\nThe band went on a tour the same year and also supported Black Sabbath on their Born Again tour in the U.S.\n\nSlick Black Cadillac is a re-recorded version of the same song from Quiet Riot II.\n\nThe song Thunderbird was dedicated to guitarist and ex-member Randy Rhoads, who died in a plane crash on March 19, 1982.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Metal Health&quot; (DuBrow/Cavazo/Sarzo/Banali) 5:16\n2. &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; (Holder/Lea) 4:51\n3. &quot;Don't Wanna Let You Go&quot; (DuBrow/Cavazo) 4:42\n4. &quot;Slick Black Cadillac&quot; (DuBrow/Rhoads) 4:12\n5. &quot;Love's a Bitch&quot; (DuBrow) 4:11\n6. &quot;Breathless&quot; (DuBrow/Cavazo) 3:51\n7. &quot;Run for Cover&quot; (DuBrow/Cavazo) 3:38\n8. &quot;Battle Axe&quot; (Cavazo) 1:38\n9. &quot;Let's Get Crazy&quot; (DuBrow) 4:08\n10. &quot;Thunderbird&quot; (DuBrow) 4:43\n\n[edit] 2001 The Metal Remasters Bonus Tracks (included in the torrent)\n\n11. &quot;Danger Zone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n12. &quot;Slick Black Cadillac (live)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782a4fab1f9ada48ab08131744c3e8fc4eaf5512","amp;dn":"Quiet+Riot+-+Metal+Health+2+bonus+tracks+remastered+covers+inclu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782a4fab1f9ada48ab08131744c3e8fc4eaf5512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,42,79,171,31,154,218,72,171,8,19,23,68,195,232,252,78,175,85,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
