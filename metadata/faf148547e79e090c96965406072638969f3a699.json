The idea was to eliminate the need for interested people to have to go through the time and hassle of having to hunt down and click on links for each and every Gene Scott torrent individually.\n\nA lot of new material has surfaced since that original &quot;Torrent Pak&quot; was posted, so the present collection contains the .torrent files for ALL Gene Scott torrents released to date that we are aware of -- up to and including the &quot;Sept 2010 Third Collection.&quot;\n\nJust follow the included instructions and you'll be downloading ALL of Gene Scott's material in no time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf148547e79e090c96965406072638969f3a699","amp;dn":"GENE+SCOTT+-+SEPTEMBER+2010+-+FOURTH+-+UPDATED+TORRENT+PAK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf148547e79e090c96965406072638969f3a699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,241,72,84,126,121,224,144,201,105,101,64,96,114,99,137,105,243,166,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
