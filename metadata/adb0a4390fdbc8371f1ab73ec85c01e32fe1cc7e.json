Frank Baum in 1900 is loaded with powerful symbols of monetary reform which were the core of the Populist movement and the 1896 and 1900 president bid of Democrat William Jennings Bryan.\n--The yellow brick road (gold standard), the emerald city of Oz (greenback money), even DorothyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s silver slippers (changed to ruby slippers for the movie version) were the symbol of BaumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and BryanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s belief that adding silver coinage to gold would provide much needed money to a depression-strapped, 1890s America.\n--We believe BaumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s symbols represent the only solution to relieve the growing economic hardship here in America ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the rest of the world. Practically speaking, 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the 1939 MGM release of the The Wizard of Oz movie, so interest will be very high.
