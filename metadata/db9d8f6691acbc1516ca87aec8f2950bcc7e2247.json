Rosas danst Rosas, a choreography for four dancers, was created at the Brussels Kaaitheaster Festival in 1983.\n\nFour dancers do battle; with each other, with the stage and with the public - a fight to the bitter end - set to the minimalistic music of Peter Vermeersch and Thierry De Mey. One camera records the dance itself and a second highlights specific details using close-ups and panning camera movements. The way in which the images are edited give the film an extra rhythmical layer.
