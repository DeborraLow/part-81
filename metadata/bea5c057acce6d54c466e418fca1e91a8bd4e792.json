Dr. Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a clinical psychologist who works alongside her husband, Dr. Doug Grey (Charles S. Dutton), in the mental ward of a top security prison, where Miranda has been devoting much of her attention to a clever but deeply disturbed murderer named Chloe (PenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lope Cruz), who shares gruesome tales of torture and violence that may or may not be based in fact. One night, Miranda has a hideous nightmare in which a chance meeting with a strange young girl leads to a terrifying journey into madness. Once she wakes, however, Miranda discovers that the real horror has just begun -- Doug has been brutally murdered, and the evidence points to Miranda as the prime suspect. She soon finds herself a patient in the same facility where she once treated others, and finds that her claims of innocence and sanity do little to convince Dr. Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.), the psychologist assigned to her case. Gothika marked the American debut of acclaimed and controversial French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 38 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea5c057acce6d54c466e418fca1e91a8bd4e792","amp;dn":"Gothika%282003%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea5c057acce6d54c466e418fca1e91a8bd4e792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,165,192,87,172,206,109,84,196,102,228,24,252,161,233,26,139,212,231,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
