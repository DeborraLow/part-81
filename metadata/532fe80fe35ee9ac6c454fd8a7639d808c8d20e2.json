This torrent contains an almost complete Therion discography, in FLAC quality. The demos are only to be found in mp3, and given they were only released on tape, I doubt FLAC would do them any justice.\nBeyond Sanctorum,  Of Darkness, Symphony Masses - Ho Drakon Ho Megas are only included as remasters.\n\nSources: FLACs come from either various private trackers, or from my own rips (deggial, secret of the runes, live in midgard, sitra ahra). I have transcoded every lossless file with the highest FLAC quality, thus wasting more cpu cycles, for the sake of lower file sizes. I did not scan any artwork.\n\nFile naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). Artwork was also reduced to a decent file size. I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus also removing the cue sheets. I like my music folders clean and my stuff organized.\n\nWhat's missing?\n&quot;of darkness...&quot;, early studio version. everything I found was the TECoR remaster\nsingles\ndvds 3 &amp; 4 from celebrators of becoming. they contain mostly old video footage and bootlegs before theli and the audio rip of live in mexico city (which is actually ripped directly from dvd on discs 1 and 2)\n\nauzi's metal collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532fe80fe35ee9ac6c454fd8a7639d808c8d20e2","amp;dn":"therion+-+complete+flac+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532fe80fe35ee9ac6c454fd8a7639d808c8d20e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,47,232,15,227,94,233,172,108,69,79,216,167,99,157,128,140,141,32,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
