A tape of the concert was found in the basement of San Francisco critic Ralph Gleason, a co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine, after Gleason's death, and was issued in 2010 by Columbia Records. It was offered as a bonus disc by Amazon.com with either The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 or Dylan's The Original Mono Recordings for a limited time after its release. The album was offically released on April 12, 2011 in the United States, and a day earlier in Europe.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Concert_-_Brandeis_University_1963&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Concert_-_Brandeis_University_1963&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nA long-unknown recording of Bob Dylan performing at a Brandeis folk music festival in 1963 will be released next week -- with a catch.\n\nYou canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t buy just this recording ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bonus for people who use Amazon.com to make an advance purchase of the Dylan Bootleg Series Vol. 9 or The Original Mono Recordings before next Tuesday.\n\nJeff Rosen, a New York City-based representative of the iconic poet-musician, said that the bonus deal was set up to promote sales of the latest in the Bootleg series, and that the Brandeis performance would be available for purchase singly in January.\n\nThe Brandeis concert took place on May 10, 1963; it was scheduled for the Ullman Amphitheater, as reported in the April 30, 1963, edition of The Justice:\n\n&quot;Friday evening will again feature two events: the Poses Symposium on Contemporary Art and Criticism, and the opening concert of the Brandeis Folk Festival. Both events are set for 8:30: the latter, which will be held outdoors in the Ullman Amphitheater, or in the Shapiro Athletic Center in case of rain, will feature the following performers: Bob Dylan, one of the new and most exciting blues performers; Jean Redpath, foremost singer of Scottish ballads, Don Stover and the Lilly Brothers from West Virginia and Boston's Hillbilly Ranch; Jesse Fuller, who described himself as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the last great vaudeville artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and who delighted an audience at Cholmondeley's in October; and the silver leaf Gospel Singers.&quot;\n\nThere is an indication on the tape -- an announcer's reference to the concert being in the gym-- that it might actually have rained and forced relocation of the festival.\n\nAnd what, Brandeisians of today might ask, is the Ullman Amphitheater? It was a covered space, open on the sides, on the slope between the new Shapiro Science Center and the Bernstein-Marcus administrative complex. That's where graduations were held until the early 1990s, when the Gosman Sports and Convocation Center replaced it.\n\nThe recording was &quot;discovered&quot; by Jeff Gold of recordmecca.com and Toby Gleason as they sifted through a massive music collection in the basement rooms of GleasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family home. GleasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father, the late Ralph J. Gleason, was the first fulltime jazz and pop critic at an American newspaper, and was co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine. He was early to recognize the significance of Dylan, Lenny Bruce and Miles Davis, and was close to many of the musicians of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAfter Ralph GleasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1975, his family preserved what Gold describes on his blog as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa vast archive of records, magazines, newspapers, posters, press materials and all kinds of ephemera,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but allowed a few pieces to be purchased by music cognoscenti ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ of whom Gold was one. When GleasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife died in 2009, a decision was made to sell the family home, and Gold was offered a much broader chance to make purchases.\n\nHere, in part, is how Gold describes the discovery on the blog post:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor two or three days, Toby and I explored the deep recesses of the home's multi-room basement, which was filled with magazines, records, newspapers and reel to reel tapes. When we came to the wall of tapes, we discovered many labeled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Bob Dylan.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Gleason had been one of Dylan's early and most vocal supporters, and became close to himÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Toby and I agreed that since we didn't know what was on them, I'd take them back to Los Angeles and listenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. The first time I went to the studio, I brought a few of the tapes I thought most promising. One was labeled only ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Dylan BrandeisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in light pencil on the edge of the box. We ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“put it upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the machine, the playback started, and I was blown away. Superb quality--obviously professionally recorded -- early Dylan, singing and playing wonderfully. And a recording I'd never heard of -- and was pretty sure was unknown (which it was.) Over the next few weeks, I listened to many many hours of Dylan tapes, and of course, everything else had been released or bootlegged, save for a tape of a press conference from Austin, Tx. in 1965. Still, after all these years, to find an unknown Dylan tape, and one this good -- I was astounded.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe songs recorded at Brandeis were: &quot;Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot; (incomplete), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ John Birch Paranoid Blues,&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Ballad of Hollis Brown,&quot; &quot;Masters of War,&quot; &quot;TalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ World War Three Blues,&quot; &quot;Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream,&quot; and &quot;TalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.brandeis.edu/now/2010/october/dylan.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.brandeis.edu/now/2010/october/dylan.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1st set:\n\n01.
