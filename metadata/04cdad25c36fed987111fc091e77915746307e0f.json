These arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t so much surveys as they are psychological questionnaires. Why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t they just start giving Republicans those inkblot Rorschach tests? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat do you see here?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI see Barack Obama sacrificing Christian babies to Satan.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In the latest poll, 52 percent of Republicans agree with the statement that President Obama ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsympathizes with the goals of Islamic fundamentalists who want to impose Islamic law around the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HmmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ maybe the results wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be so extreme if they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t phrase the questions like a Glenn-Beck-on-cough-medicine rant. On the other hand, I guess they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just ask them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo you believeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ basically anything some rightwing nutbag could dream up?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Still, I suspect they would say yes. If you ask Republicans ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow many fingers am I holding up?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the answer would be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObama is the devil.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It saves them from counting. This poll also shows that 59 percent of Republicans said they believed the president favored ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe interests of Muslims over other groups of Americans.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That one is a little surprising. I had no idea that many Republicans considered Muslims to be Americans.\n\nHow can they keep us this level of ignorance? Glenn Beck is certainly doing his part. Beck has launched a new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnews and opinionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ website. Of course, to Glenn Beck, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no distinction between news and opinion. His opinions are wrong, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure all the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on his site is going to be wrong too. Beck said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so hard to find a place that helps me make sense of the world I see.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all with you there, Glenn. I certainly canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make any sense out of the world YOU see. Gee Glenn, if you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make sense of the world youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing, is it just possible that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not seeing the real world? BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new site is called TheBlaze.com. Incidentally, The Blaze is already up and, well, blazing. Surprised? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not like they had to spend any time researching their stories. The banner headline when I logged on was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œExplicit Poetry GPS Phones Help Illegals.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Really. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not going to click on the link for the article. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to just let my imagination run wildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure is pretty much what the author of that piece did. Check it out for yourself. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m too busy texting excerpts from Allen GinsbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHowlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to immigrants in the desert suffering from hypothermia and sunstroke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cdad25c36fed987111fc091e77915746307e0f","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+August+31+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cdad25c36fed987111fc091e77915746307e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,205,173,37,195,111,237,152,113,17,252,9,30,119,145,87,70,48,126,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
