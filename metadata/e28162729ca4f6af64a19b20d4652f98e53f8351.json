Her health deteriorates and she is rapidly spirited away to hospital, where she reconstructs her office routine, appropriating doctors, other hospital staff and patients as replacements for her co-workers. It is soon revealed, through hints that she has lost her job and her co-workers havent bothered to visit, that she is not as popular and significant as she assumed. \n\nKatherine Patricia Routledge, CBE (born 17 February 1929) is an English theatre, television, and film actress and singer. She is best known for her roles on British television, most notably as Hyacinth Bucket on Keeping Up Appearances. In addition to her roles in British television, she has a long and successful career in musical theatre, as well as in film. She currently lives in Chichester, West Sussex.\n\nAlan Bennett (born 9 May 1934) is an English playwright.  Many of Bennetts characters are unfortunate and downtrodden, or meek and overlooked. Life has brought them to an impasse, or else passed them by altogether. In many cases they have met with disappointment in the realm of sex and intimate relationships, largely through tentativeness and a failure to connect with others.\n\nBennett is both unsparing and compassionate in laying bare his characters frailties. This can be seen in his television plays for LWT in the late 1970s and the BBC in the early 1980s, and in the 1987 Talking Heads series of monologues for television.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28162729ca4f6af64a19b20d4652f98e53f8351","amp;dn":"A+Woman+of+No+Importance+%28TV%29+%5B1982%5D+Patricia+Routledge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28162729ca4f6af64a19b20d4652f98e53f8351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,129,98,114,156,164,246,175,100,161,155,32,212,101,47,152,229,63,131,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
