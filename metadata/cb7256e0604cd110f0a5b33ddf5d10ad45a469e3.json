Andreas Sten, violin on &quot;Skoghens\nMinnen V?kks&quot; and &quot;Gamall Uvermark&quot;.\n\nNotes:\nThe low level on the album is ment to get listeners to max their volume and let\nthe thunder in the end of &quot;Skoghens Minnen V?kks&quot; crack their speakers. &quot;Et\nSorghetog&quot; was originally recorded with low pitched vocals. Photographies taken\nby Fredrik Backar, under Shamaatae?s direction. Logos, pencil drawings and hand\nwritings by Shamaatae. The wooden staff is hand made by Shamaatae, it took him\ntwo weeks with a soldering iron to burn all the sigills, texts and pictures\ninto the staff (only (dumb) perfectionists does these kind of things!!). During\nthe time this album was recorded, LP III &quot;Kampen&quot; and LP IV &quot;Faunaz Samgang&quot;\nwere completed. &quot;O?egar?r&quot; and &quot;O?er Trulhoyghda&quot; are the parts two (Del II)\nand three (Del III) in the manifesto of the secret village of Tribalerna.
