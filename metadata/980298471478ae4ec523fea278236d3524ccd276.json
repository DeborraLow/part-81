If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980298471478ae4ec523fea278236d3524ccd276","amp;dn":"iPod-Cloner+1.80+build+850+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980298471478ae4ec523fea278236d3524ccd276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,2,152,71,20,120,174,78,197,35,254,162,120,35,109,53,36,204,210,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
