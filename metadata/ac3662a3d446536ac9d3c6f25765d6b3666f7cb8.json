It appears on the album Brothers in Arms. It became the band's fourth top 20 hit on the Billboard charts, peaking at #19.\n\nBrothers in Arms is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Dire Straits, released in 1985. The first half of the album is a development of their unique brand of arena rock which had evolved in their music since the 1980 album Making Movies, while the second half consists of more folk-influenced material. The whole album maintains the original Dire Straits' bluesy and laid back guitar-based style whilst utilising a more lavish and bombastic production and overall sound. It is the band's best-selling album, one of the top 10 best-selling albums in UK music history, and has sold 30 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed Brothers in Arms at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In November 2006, the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. Brothers in Arms came in at number 64 (see &quot;My Favourite Album&quot;). Brothers in Arms is ranked number 3 in the best albums of 1985 and number 31 in the best albums of the 1980s.\n\nAs of April 30, 2008, Brothers in Arms was 5th on the list of best-selling albums (UK) and is the 107th best-selling album in the United States.\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards.\n\nDire Straits were a British rock band, formed by Mark Knopfler (vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion), and managed by Ed Bicknell, active between 1977 and 1995. Although the band was formed in an era when punk rock was at the forefront, Dire Straits played a more bluesy style, albeit with a stripped-down sound that appealed to audiences weary of the overproduced stadium rock of the 1970s. In their early days, Mark and David requested that pub owners turn down their sound so that patrons could converse while the band played, an indication of their unassuming demeanor. Despite this oddly self-effacing approach to rock and roll, Dire Straits soon became hugely successful, with their first album going multi-platinum globally.\n\nThroughout the band's career Mark Knopfler was the songwriter and driving force behind the group. The band's best-known songs include &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler have sold in excess of 120 million albums to date.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3662a3d446536ac9d3c6f25765d6b3666f7cb8","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+So+Far+Away+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3662a3d446536ac9d3c6f25765d6b3666f7cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,54,98,163,212,70,83,106,201,211,198,242,87,101,214,179,102,111,124,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
