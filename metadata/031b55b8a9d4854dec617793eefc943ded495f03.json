Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind relativity and quantum physics are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. As Professor Wolfson points out, the essence of relativity can be summed up in a single sentence: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.\n\nThe same goes for quantum theory, which is based on the principle that the &quot;stuff &quot; of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½matter and energyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is not infinitely divisible but comes in discrete chunks called &quot;quanta.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031b55b8a9d4854dec617793eefc943ded495f03","amp;dn":"Modern+Physics+for+Non-Scientists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031b55b8a9d4854dec617793eefc943ded495f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,27,85,184,169,212,133,77,236,97,119,147,238,252,148,61,237,73,95,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
