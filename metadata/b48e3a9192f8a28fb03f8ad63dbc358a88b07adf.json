It also feels like Sense itself.\nNone of this is my software, I have just put it all together for easy downloading.\n\nJust install the LuncherPro Sense UI Mod apk, set it as the default homescreen. \nThen, install Fancy Widget and add it to the homescreen (Exclude from your task killer if installed).\n For the Sense lockscreen, install Lockbot, go to 'My themes', hit the menu button and go to 'Playlist', uncheck all themes except for 'Hero' and you're set.\n\nUnfortunately, the task bar cannot be modified without root, so I am not adding it in this torrent. Feel free to Google away.\nIf you want a HTC keyboard, Google search &quot;HTC Sense keyboard&quot; and see what that yield.\n\nHope this helps in some way! \n\nTested on a Samsung Galaxy 5 GT-i5500 on Android 2.2 Froyo.\n\ndedhaxor9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48e3a9192f8a28fb03f8ad63dbc358a88b07adf","amp;dn":"HTC+Sense+Themepack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48e3a9192f8a28fb03f8ad63dbc358a88b07adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,142,58,145,146,248,162,143,176,63,138,214,61,188,53,138,136,176,122,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
