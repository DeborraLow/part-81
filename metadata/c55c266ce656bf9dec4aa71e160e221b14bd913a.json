Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, one of the world's most cunning and feared serial killers, who resurfaces after a decade in hiding to toy with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). As Starling's career flounders thanks to a drug bust gone wrong, Lecter attempts to elude a greedy Italian police detective (Giancarlo Giannini) who's willing to alert the authorities to his presence in Florence for a price. In the meantime, a maimed but wealthy former victim of Lecter's named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) plots to get his revenge on the doctor in a most unusual and grisly fashion. The novel by Thomas Harris was adapted for director Ridley Scott by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 11 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55c266ce656bf9dec4aa71e160e221b14bd913a","amp;dn":"Hannibal%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55c266ce656bf9dec4aa71e160e221b14bd913a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,92,38,108,230,86,191,157,236,74,167,30,22,14,34,27,20,189,145,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
