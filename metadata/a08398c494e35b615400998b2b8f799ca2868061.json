But it never lacks focus or meaning.\nHere you will find warmth, spirit, curiosity and inventiveness. Six of the\nten tracks are Christian JorminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own compositions, the rest are\nimprovisations on choral melodies. The trio, which came together in the\n1990's, features - apart from Christian Jormin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the bassist Mattias\nGrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nroos and Magnus Boqvist on drums.\n\n&quot;This music has evolved during the church concerts weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had over the\nyears. Music with a contemplative basic character. Simultaneously full of\nmovement and surprises. Some call it meditative jazz. In our opinion, it doesn't\nmatter what it's called. If you look at something from a distance, a pattern\nemerges. When you move in closer, you can distinguish the details.&quot; Christian\nJormin\n\n&quot;Lean back and enjoy the ride!&quot; Sundsvalls Tidning\n\n&quot;Sensitive and skillful craftsmanship of a higher order&quot; Uppsala Nya Tidning\n\n&quot;Pride, vigour and elegance are just a few of the words that come to mind when I\nlisten to Sol Salutis.&quot; JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pingsposten\n\n01 - Det tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nds ett ljus/ A Light Has Been Lit\n02 - Den sista vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rlden/ The Last World\n03 - Dream City\n04 - Det finns en vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤g/ There Is a Way\n05 - VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndkors/ Turnstile\n06 - Sol Ottilia\n07 - PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rlor skÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶na/ Pearls of Beauty\n08 - I Hoppet/ In Hope\n09 - Sol Salutis\n10 - M\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08398c494e35b615400998b2b8f799ca2868061","amp;dn":"Christian+Jormin+3+-+Sol+Salutis+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08398c494e35b615400998b2b8f799ca2868061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,131,152,196,148,227,91,97,84,0,153,139,43,143,121,156,162,134,128,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
