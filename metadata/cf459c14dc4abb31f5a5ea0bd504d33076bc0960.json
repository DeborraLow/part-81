Though Zuba tries to teach Alakay to be a hunter, the\ncub is more interested in dancing, and is captured by poachers when Makunga, Zuba's rival, challenges Zuba to a fight for the position of\nalpha lion. Alakay is forced into a crate, and though Zuba tries to rescue his son, he is shot in the ear and fails. The crate falls into the ocean\nwhere it drifts to New York. There, Alakay is renamed Alex and sent to the Central Park Zoo where he grew up, meeting Marty, Melman,\nand Gloria. The events of the first film are then described through a series of news flashes.In the present time, Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria,\nKing Julien, Maurice, the chimpanzees, Skipper and his fellow penguins board a repaired airplane in the hopes of using it to fly back to New\nYork. Mort tries to board the plane but King Julien doesn't want him on board and locks him outside. The plane takes off and starts with a\nrelaxing journey. Alex later spots Mort clinging to the wing of the plane and waves to him (causing Mort to wave back and fall off the wing\ninto the sea). The plane soon ends up crash-landing in continental Africa when it runs out of fuel. In Africa the animals are amazed to find more\nof their kind. Alex is reunited with Zuba and his mother. Marty quickly fits in with a herd of zebra who all look, sound, and talk exactly like\nhim. Melman takes on the position of witch doctor amongst the animals. Gloria, interested in finding a mate, attracts the attention of a smooth\n-talking but shallow hippo named Moto Moto.Meanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane. They carjack several jeeps from New\nYorkers on vacation under &quot;Operation Tourist Trap&quot;, leaving the tourists stranded and lost in the jungle. Taking charge of the group is Nana,\na tough old woman known for having beaten up Alex before he was first shipped out of New York in the first film, reminding them that they\nare New Yorkers and survivors.The next morning Mort washes up on the shore of Africa and sets off to find King Julien, chased by a hungry shark.\nUnfortunately, life in Africa is not as wonderful as it first seemed. Makunga, still determined to take the position of alpha lion, reminds Zuba\nthat Alex must complete a traditional lion coming-of-age challenge that he did not complete. Alex, thinking that the challenge is a dance contest\n(it is actually a fight) competes against the strongest lion, Teetsie (who was recommended by Makunga) and loses quickly. To avoid being\nforced to banish his own son for failing, Zuba relinquishes his title as Alpha lion. Makunga immediately takes the position and banishes Alex\nand his family, much to Zuba's anger at Alex. Marty, meanwhile, begins to feel upset that all of the zebras are exactly the same as him, leaving\nhim with nothing unique. Melman is happy as a witch doctor until he learns that he has the same spot that had apparently caused the previous\nwitch doctor to die. Melman is also upset about Gloria dating Moto Moto, as Melman has secretly loved her for a long time. Gloria goes on a\ndate with Moto Moto, in a lake, and quickly realizes that he only loves her for her body.The next day, the animals are in a panic when they\ndiscover that the watering hole has dried up. Determined to make up for his earlier failure, Alex and Marty decide to risk being shot by hunters\nand leave the reserve to discover what has happened. The pair discover that the stranded New Yorkers, under the instruction of Nana, have\ndammed up the river and built a primitive civilization. Alex is subsequently captured by a trap, causing Marty to abandon him to seek help. Meanwhile,\nZuba hears from Makunga what Alex did and goes to rescue him.Back on the reserve, King Julien suggests that the animals sacrifice one of themselves\nat the volcano to appease the water gods and regain their water supply. Believing that he will die soon, Melman volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria\nstops him just in time and Marty arrives to tell them about Alex. The trio, the penguins, and several chimpanzees use the newly-fixed plane to execute\na rescue.However, Alex has already managed to rescue both himself and his father by dancing for the New Yorkers, who quickly recognize him\nfrom the zoo. The other animals arrive to pick them up with the plane, and together they all destroy the dam, freeing the water Meanwhile, back\nat the volcano, King Julien complains to Maurice about the sacrifice plan not working (&quot;The science seemed so solid&quot;. Mort turns up and is\noverjoyed to see King Julien, although Julien is less than thrilled to see him. The shark that was chasing Mort also arrives but falls into the volcano,\ncompleting the sacrifice (with Maurice saying &quot;I hope the gods like Seafood&quot; and causing King Julien to think that he brought back the water.\n\nAs the watering hole restores, Makunga angrily reminds Alex and Zuba that all this won't change anything. However, Alex manages to remove\nMakunga from power by tricking Nana into attacking him, and she drags him back to the other marooned tourists. Zuba steps down from being\nAlpha Lion, giving the position to Alex, but Alex in turn refuses, resulting in both father and son becoming the leaders.The movie ends as Skipper\nmarries a bobble-head hula doll from the plane and leaves on a honeymoon in Monte Carlo with the chimpanzees, and a huge tub of diamonds\nand gold, leaving Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to happily remain in Africa with Alex's parents.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf459c14dc4abb31f5a5ea0bd504d33076bc0960","amp;dn":"Madagaskar-EsCape+2+AfriCa+%5B2008%5D+%5BAVi%5D+%5BDvDRiP%5D+---+PhoeniX+RG+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf459c14dc4abb31f5a5ea0bd504d33076bc0960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,69,156,20,220,74,187,49,245,165,234,11,213,4,211,48,118,188,9,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
