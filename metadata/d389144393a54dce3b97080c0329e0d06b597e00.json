You needed it a whole lot worse than I did. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d389144393a54dce3b97080c0329e0d06b597e00","amp;dn":"Phone+Call+From+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d389144393a54dce3b97080c0329e0d06b597e00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,137,20,67,147,165,77,206,59,151,8,12,3,41,224,208,107,89,126,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
