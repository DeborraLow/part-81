B.o.B shot his scenes for the video in April, but Williams was only able to shoot her parts after the end of Paramore's spring tour, so they were never in the same room during filming. The music video, directed by Hiro Murai, premiered on iTunes on Tuesday June 15, 2010. The video features several frames of B.o.B rapping his verses in a party setting, on stage, and room filled with lights and occasional song lyrics while Hayley Williams sings the hook in a light filled room and walking through photographs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86763bf3de2c85a791ff459948e7921ec135171","amp;dn":"B.o.B_ft_Hayley_Williams-Airplanes-DVDRip-x264-2010-MVcl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86763bf3de2c85a791ff459948e7921ec135171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,103,99,191,61,226,200,90,121,31,244,89,148,142,121,33,236,19,81,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
