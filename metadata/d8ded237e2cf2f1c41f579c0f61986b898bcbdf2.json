IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most renowned Vedic authority presents startling evidence of the soulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nincredible journey after death. Srila Prabhupada tells how the soul travels from body to body, and how we\ncan end the cycle of birth and death by reaching Lord Sri KrishnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ultimate abode. An excerpt: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe simple\nprocess of chanting the names of Krishna will reveal what one is, what God is, what the material and spiritual\nuniverses are, why we are conditioned, how we can get out of that conditioning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and everything else,.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½But \nisnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it true that the essence of ChristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s teachings is about how to live in this world? CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you drop your\nconcern for the next world and still be Christians?\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like saying you can drop hope for a communist revolution and a classless society and still be a \ncommunist.\n\nBut hope for heaven diverts you from making earth a better place to live in. You Christians are really \ntraitors to the earth.\n\nNo. Throughout history it has been precisely those who believed most strongly in the next world who did \nthe most to improve this one. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what you would expect. If you believe the road youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on goes nowhere,\nyou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take it too seriously. If you believe it goes to somewhere important, you keep it up. If a pregnant\nwoman thinks her baby will be born dead, she does not take much care of it. If she hopes it will have life \nafter birth, she takes care of her pregnancy.But concern for the next world is escapism.Who talks the most \nagainst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œescapismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? Jailers.
