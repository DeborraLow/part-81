Another 13 wins &amp; 16 nominations\n\nRating: 7.8/10 - from 20,255 users\n\nDirected by Thomas McCarthy. \n\nStarring Richard Jenkins, Haaz Sleiman, Danai Gurira. \n\nA college professor travels to New York City to attend a conference and finds a young couple living in his apartment.\n\n&quot;Thomas McCarthy's follow-up to the enchanting &quot;The Station Agent&quot; (2003) is another contemplative drama filled with subtle humor and a lot of humanity/passion for its characters. Walter (Richard Jenkins, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) is a widowed college professor that meets two illegal immigrants - a Senegalese woman (Danai Gurira) and a Syrian man, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) -, living in his apartment in NYC. After the initial discomfort of the situation, Walter decides to help the young couple and an unlikely friendship is born.\n\n&quot;The Visitor&quot; deals with human relationships and discusses post-9/11 America socio-political issues (the plight of immigrants, xenophobia, etc.) with no hidden agendas. McCarthy has proved himself as a sensitive director/writer, and he extracts a magnificent performance from Richard Jenkins, a character actor who gets his first leading role at the age of 60. Jenkins is fascinating to watch as an ordinary man trying to find himself; he gives one of the best male performances of the decade and I'd love if he got at least an Oscar nomination, since I can see him remaining in my top 5 by the end of the year, perhaps still as my favourite. I know that the movie's small indie weight and the fact that it was released early in the year will probably hurt his chances (the Independent Spirit Award could be his biggest reward), but if it's strongly campaigned, it might get a nod ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la &quot;The Savages&quot; (even though I know he's not half big a name as Laura Linney). Anyway, I hope he gets some sort of recognition - he'll also be seen later this year in the Coens' &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;. If you like human dramas, sensitive writing/directing and superb acting, you should check &quot;The Visitor&quot; - the finest 2008 release I've seen so far. 10/10.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bf3b499cb7b7a9a12c53db03508b9f84bb3a69","amp;dn":"The.Visitor.2007.LIMITED.BluRay.480p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bf3b499cb7b7a9a12c53db03508b9f84bb3a69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,191,59,73,156,183,183,169,161,44,83,219,3,80,139,159,132,187,58,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
