A founding member of Irish super-groups LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnasa and the now legendary Coolfin, John is finally releasing his first solo album SOMA. A fiery blend of pipes, whistles, guitars, bouzoukis and fiddles, SOMA mixes traditional tunes with John's own compositions\n\nA masterpiece of restraint and nobility...His scattering\nof self-composed tunes still bear many traces of his\nrhythmic escapades with LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnasa. Aptly christened,\nSoma is a highly balanced and controlled body of work. --Irish Times \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/04/08/john-mc-sherry/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543cc2d6fe554dce366f0d2bc681b82a79ff4f16","amp;dn":"John+McSherry...Soma%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543cc2d6fe554dce366f0d2bc681b82a79ff4f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,60,194,214,254,85,77,206,54,111,13,43,198,129,184,42,121,255,79,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
