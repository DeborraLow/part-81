The Last Waltz was advertised as the end of The Band's illustrious touring career, and the concert saw The Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including Paul Butterfield, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Ronnie Hawkins, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Ronnie Wood and Neil Young.\n\nThe event was filmed by director Martin Scorsese and made into a documentary of the same name, released in 1978. The film features concert performances, scenes shot on a studio soundstage and interviews by Scorsese with members of The Band. A triple-LP soundtrack recording was issued in 1978. The film was released on DVD in 2002 as was a four-CD box set of the concert and related studio recordings.\n\nThe Last Waltz is hailed as one of the greatest concert films ever made, although it has been criticized for its focus on Robbie Robertson.\n\n*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nMonday:  True Blood, Mad Men, Entourage as 320p H264;\nTuesday: Lie to Me,  Weeds, Hung as 320p H264;\nWednesday: Covert Affairs, Rescue Me as 320p H264\nThursday: Memphis Beat as 320p H264\nFriday: Burn Notice, Futurama, Rookie Blue as 320p H264\nSaturday: The Pillars Of The Earth as 320p H264\n\nNOTE: [lepton] family = frame-size 368/416x-2 (AR) pixels, 16:9 or 2.35 aspect ratio\n             ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. \n             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, \n             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).       \n      272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds\n             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems (CURRENTLY &quot;ON HOLD&quot;)\n      320p = frame-size 576x320 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, or 576x240 for 2.35:1\n             (movies/theatrical AR)middle-format, playback\n             ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. \n             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, \n             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).       \n      352p = frame-size 624x352 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback\n             ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. \n             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, \n             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).       \n      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback\n             as for 272p (except streaming)\n      480p = frame-size 720x480 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304\n             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)\n      720p = frame-size 1280x720 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 1280x528-544\n             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR), hardware intensive\n      \n      Most problems people have are with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend \n      and have used one system for years - CoreAVC for H264 \n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4787782/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4787782/&lt;/a&gt;\n      (&quot;Deblocking&quot; set to &quot;Standard&quot;) and part of DivX7-8 for AAC - \n      AAC DirectShow filter.\n\n      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p \n      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)\n      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreAVC \n      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).\n      \n      New DivX8 is maybe 18% slower than Core AVC and very common, \n      and in order to use DivX8 H264 and AAC DS filters outside DivX7 or 8 player \n      (as in Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic), Haali spliter \n      must be installed. Beware, however, that video quality could be very much\n      degraded on encodings where extremely low bit-rates have been used.\n      TIP: Switch back and forth between Core AVC and DivX H264 DS filters by marking\n      and un-marking Core AVC &quot;Preferred decoder&quot; setting.\n      \n      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following \n      and-or a combination of these:  the playback system itself, a \n      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. \n      \n      For instance, any so called &quot;jerky&quot; playback of &quot;system-heavy&quot; 720p comes\n      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded \n      computer. Use of ddshow filters and &quot;codecs&quot; is suicidal. This is not \n      Russian 720p Matroska format (&quot;official&quot; 720p) and completely different \n      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent\n      &quot;hide&quot; bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, \n      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as \n      much as possible.\n        \n      Any &quot;blurriness&quot; of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. \n      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,\n      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.\n      Any &quot;blockiness&quot; comes from &quot;system-too-slow&quot; situation, when\n       decoding engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot \n       process all frames as it supposed to.\n      On &quot;I have no video&quot; and &quot;I have no sound&quot; I don't waste my time as this \n      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. \n      RTFM is the best response I can give.\n\n      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC \n      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of \n      any kind.\n\n      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).\n      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\n      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system \n      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones \n      with Line In of any Stereo rack).\n\n******************************************************************\n\nMy computer has died and been resurrected numerous times now and it may fail\nfor good at any time.\nFor some reason I still have faith in human nature and my fans, in\nparticular, even if they have let me down for the most part up to now.\nI have to use a 3rd party service to UP my torrents. The funding\nfor this service ($15) has, after much agonising on my part, been taken from\nthe donations I have received from those who kept their word and donated\nmoney to me for new PC. This was not an easy decision but I have been\nrelying on other fans to keep my work alive and have decided that if I have\nto go out, I will go out on my feet. Fighting my PC until we both expire to\nUP torrents that so many seem to want but are unwilling to help continue the\nservice.\n\nThis then is the situation. I will continue to UP as long as I can and then\none day I will not be there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89478a43e9a50a27677c0489b5a898af38086eaf","amp;dn":"The.Last.Waltz.1978.PROPER.BDRip.352p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89478a43e9a50a27677c0489b5a898af38086eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,71,138,67,233,165,10,39,103,124,4,137,181,168,152,175,56,8,110,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
