Kenny Burrell and Wes Montgomery may have a sweeter sound, but it is difficult for anyone to approach Pass' stunning dexterity. The album, which consists of Pass playing a number of standards without accompaniment (and no overdubbing, of course), shows that Pass complemented his fretboard wizardry with a solid ear for improvisation and melody. You'll get the occasional glimpse of rock'n roll influence as well. All in  all, a  staggering  achievement.  Highly   recommended  for jazz fans, and a must-own for the jazz guitar fan.\n\n\nTracklist\n1.\tNight And Day 3:2\n2.\tStella By Starlight 5:09\n3.\tHere's That Rainy Day 3:\n4.\tMy Old Flame 5:15\n5.\tHow High The Moon 5:00\n6.\tCherokee 3:38\n7.\tSweet Lorraine 4:09\n8.\tHave You Met Miss Jones? 4:44\n9.\t'Round Midnight 3:38\n10.\tAll The Things You Are 4:00\n11.\tBlues For Alican 5:28\n12.\tThe Song Is You 4:33\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4601acadc7666afd5e00de88368752bff1e5bc1","amp;dn":"Joe+Pass+Virtuoso%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4601acadc7666afd5e00de88368752bff1e5bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,96,26,202,220,118,102,175,213,224,13,232,131,104,117,43,255,30,91,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
