This dynamic belies the American belief that our free, open and integrated multicultural society lessens the allure of radicalism and terrorism for US citizens.' The report looks at a number cases of US exported terrorism, including attacks by US based or ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½nanced Jewish, Muslim and Irish-nationalism terrorists. It concludes that foreign perceptions of the US as an &quot;Exporter of Terrorism&quot; together with US double standards in international law, may lead to noncooperation in renditions (including the arrest of CIA officers) and the decision to not share terrorism related intelligence with the United States.
