The series revolves around the lives of five anthropomorphic animals who hang around the back of a pub in the Isle of Dogs, London. The characters are Nelson, a metrosexual fox (voiced by Rufus Jones); Destiny, a pretentious self-absorbed Afghan hound (Lucy Montgomery); Marion, a &quot;borderline-retarded&quot; cat (Dan Tetsell); Kali, a grudge-bearing pigeon (Katy Brand); and Vince, a sociopathic foul-mouthed fox (Paul Kaye).\n\nThe show is aimed at an adult audience, and features &quot;neutering, incontinence, cannibalism and catnip overdoses.&quot; The first episode begins with a scene in which Marion's cat friends eat their recently deceased owner. Mongrels has attracted accusations of plagiarism, with claims that Mongrels stole ideas from a similar Channel 4 show called Pets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b1372837fb852888cffd1cb2e7056ac28cdfdb","amp;dn":"Mongrels+-+Series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b1372837fb852888cffd1cb2e7056ac28cdfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,177,55,40,55,251,133,40,136,207,253,28,178,231,5,106,194,140,223,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
