Ha won Best Actor at the 5th Asian Film Awards for his turn as a desperate man on the run in a foreign land.\n\nGu-nam (Ha), a taxi driver in Yanbian, is knee deep in gambling debt, and he hasn't heard from his wife since she left for South Korea half a year ago. To clear his debt and find his wife, he reluctantly takes a job to assassinate a businessman in South Korea. When the hit job goes wrong, Gu-nam suddenly finds himself the target of the police, the mafia, and the very man who hired him, brutal assassin Myun-ga (Kim).\n\nGeneral:\n       \nFormat.......: Matroska\nFile Size....: 12804,66 MiB\nDuration.....: 2h 20mn\nBitrate......: 12.7 Mbps\n\n\nVideo:\n\nVideo Format......: AVC\nVideo Codec.......: x264 - core 115 r2008 4c552d8          \nBitrate...........: 10 Mpbs\nFrame Rate........: 23.976 fps\nAspect Ratio......: 2.35:1\nResolution........: 1920x816\n\nAudio #1:\n\nFormat..........: DTS-HDMA / DTS Core\nBitrate.........: 2 053 Kbps / 1 510 Kbps\nChannels........: 6 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Korean\n\nAudio #2:\n\nFormat..........: AC-3\nBitrate.........: 192 Kbps\nChannels........: 2 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Director &amp; Actor's Commentary - Korean\n\nAudio #3:\n\nFormat..........: AC-3\nBitrate.........: 192 Kbps\nChannels........: 2 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Director &amp; Staff's Commentary - Korean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42857310527fde5290c90c4c2c057f62823d957d","amp;dn":"Yellow+Sea+2010+DC+Bluray+1080p+DTS-HDMA+x264-LooKMaNe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42857310527fde5290c90c4c2c057f62823d957d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,133,115,16,82,127,222,82,144,201,12,76,44,5,127,98,130,61,149,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
