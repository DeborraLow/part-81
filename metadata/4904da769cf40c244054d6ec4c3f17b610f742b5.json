Sambuca wants to meet her father\n                before she dies, and enlists Lauren and Finn's help\n                to track him down in Blackpool. Keen to promote a\n                positive image of Waterloo Road, Karen hires a public\n                relations 'expert', with terrible results. Meanwhile,\n                Naomi's support of Aiden strengthens her bond with\n                Rob. Is the fledgling romance between Karen and Rob\n                over before it has begun?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4904da769cf40c244054d6ec4c3f17b610f742b5","amp;dn":"Waterloo.Road.S07E06.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4904da769cf40c244054d6ec4c3f17b610f742b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,4,218,118,156,244,12,36,64,84,214,236,76,63,23,182,16,247,66,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
