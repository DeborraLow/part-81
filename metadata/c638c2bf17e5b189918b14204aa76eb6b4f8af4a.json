SOVIA, a nurse, makes a fatal        \n    mistake in the emergency room, killing a patient. Later that night,      \n    Sovia has a surreal, near death experience in which the deceased         \n    patient appears and touches her shoulder. When Sovia recovers, she       \n    finds a bruise has developed at the exact place she was touched by       \n    the deceased. Unknowingly, she passes the bruise to others - who are     \n    then killed at the hands of the deceased. Sovia becomes the prime        \n    suspect in the murders and she begins to discover the truth. Since       \n    nobody believes her, it is up to Sovia to try to save herself and the    \n    others.                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
