It was released on October 24, 1995 in North America and on November 30, 1995 in Europe. The game is also a part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 2 portable and is part of the Sonic Gems Collection for the Nintendo GameCube. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console on February 27, 2007 in Japan and April 5, 2007 in Europe, and in North America on September 22, 2008. The game also appears in Sonics Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. It was also released on Steam as SEGA Genesis Classics Pack or stand alone Vectorman PC version.\n\nVectorman 2\n-----------\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous game. Vectorman has a different set of weapons, including a pulse beam, energy shot, and supershot guns. Vectorman can also now transform into insect forms such as a fire ant, a rhino, and &quot;shield bug&quot; that repels attacks. Unlike the original Vectorman, the full-level transformations featured in this game are not used to combat bosses as that is left to the human-form Vectorman. There are 22 levels divided into 7 parts in all.\n\nBefore Vectorman 2 was released, Sega Channel held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph Vectorman. Judges then chose the best one to be transformed in Genesis art, as well as being put on the Sega Channel. 10 runner-up submitters won a copy of Vectorman 2\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Installation]: Just double-click the setup files to begin.\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
