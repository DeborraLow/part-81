These are straight from the series, with the vocal audio accompanying.\n\nIt's not a perfect collection, but I hope you enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9afc0091942d9984f94b7d0cbf32022131d326f1","amp;dn":"FromTheEarthToTheMoon+-+A+Homemade+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9afc0091942d9984f94b7d0cbf32022131d326f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,252,0,145,148,45,153,132,249,75,125,12,191,50,2,33,49,211,38,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
