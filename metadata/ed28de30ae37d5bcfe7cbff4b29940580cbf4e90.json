Oh and I dunno whats up with the color, the scoreboard and other stuff looks fine-it's just the stadium lights? Maybe after spending all that money to build the new stadium they didn't spend the extra money to purchase the expensive high-scandium metal halide stadium bulbs.\n\nFile Size ------- 1.77gb\nLength ---------- 2:11:57\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\n\nI lost my sponsor and i'm need of a seedbox since this one is about to expire.
