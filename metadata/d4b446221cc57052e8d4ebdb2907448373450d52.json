Just over fifty minutes of cante by JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Monje Cruz, a boy of less than 17 at the time, who was already called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by friends and family due to his fair skin and hair, registered on the tape recorder purchased by Juan Vargas in order to capture treasures of cante such as this.\n\nTowards the end of the nineteen-sixties, the Venta de Vargas was a landmark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from the end of the thirties the crÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me de la crÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me of flamenco passed through. It was a veritable university of flamenco whose headmaster was called Manuel Ortega, Caracol.\n\nThat wondrous summer evening CamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n left recorded evidence of his surprising knowledge of cante, and the flamenco messages that for some reason were not circulated during his lifetime.\n\nThe first four cantes of the record were registered in the outdoors, in the very door of the inn from the counter that faced the kitchen. The sound is clear and transparent and captures, without any echo, the subtleties in CamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice and guitar.\n\nThe second half, cantes six through ten, are another story. They are from a private fiesta in the backroom of the inn. The background noise and a certain excess of echo made cleaning and masterization difficult. The bulerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­as recall El Chozas and Pastora; the siguiriyas are of El Nitri, Terremoto and Pastora; the fandangos are Caracol and de la CalzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡; the tarantos are ChacÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n and Manuel Torre and some Extremaduran tangos are clearly Porrinas and la Marelu.\n\nAs we lovingly peeled away the layers one by one, and discovered the heart of these cantes, some never-before-heard verses in CamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, and an immortal CamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, we realized just what we had in our hands.\n\n(From the booklet of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n en la Venta de VargasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Ricardo PachÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n and Enrique Montiel).\n~ deflamenco.com\n\n:: Release Info ::\nRecording Date: 1967\nRelease Date: 2005\nLabel: Universal Music\nCatalog #: 0602498690178\n\n:: Personnel ::\nGuitar (tracks 1,2,3 &amp; 4): JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Monje Cruz (Camaron de la Isla).\nGuitar (tracks 5,6,7,8,9 and 10): Manuel Brenes.\nCante: Camaron de la Isla\n\n:: track list ::\n01.
