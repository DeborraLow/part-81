We'll assume this is why a Google search of Mushi-No-Ne produces no less than half a dozen variations on the PR statement of intent for the album. What we can gather is that the title means &quot;the sound of insects&quot; and that elements of jazz and hip-hop make up the musical intention of the artists known only as No. 9. The jazz technique is there for certain, with ensemble selections dissected into ultra-minimal movements of rhythm. The opener, &quot;Gates,&quot; sounds like DJ Shadow excavated beats trimmed of all but their barest digital skeletons while &quot;Survive&quot; pixilates free jazz through a trill '70s thriller organ tone. &quot;Insatiable World&quot; actually just sounds like bugs while the 17-minute title track (indicated with only the Japanese characters) doesn't sound like much of anything except for the occasional spacey synth scale. With microscopic antennas, No. 9 picks up the barest essence of Four Tet's folk and Koop's jazz leanings, and deposits them in a fragile pile on the ground. Step cautiously.\n\nReview: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5894-mushi-no-ne/\n\nFormat: Musepack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae4cd61da167270965438a3eca478beef2dff9a","amp;dn":"No.+9+-+Mushi-No-Ne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae4cd61da167270965438a3eca478beef2dff9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,228,205,97,218,22,114,112,150,84,56,163,236,164,120,190,239,45,255,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
