Diablo 2 with expansion set (Lord of Destruction) and 1.13 patch.\n   All movies was cut because most of us saw this cinematics many times.\n2. Patch for repair to original 1.07 version of game.\n2. Loaders for 1.13, 1.12 and 1.11 version.\n3. Very tiny, near undetectable maphacks for 1.12 and 1.13.\n4. Registry keys for gateways to non-official battle.net servers (playground.ru, alkar.net, corbina.ru).\n5. Utility for change CD-key of your game.\n\nHow to use:\n1) Unpack to &quot;C:\\Games\\Diablo 2\\&quot; (or wherever you want).\n2) Run d2gateways-nonoriginal.reg for adding gateways to unofficial servers (playground.ru, alkar.net and corbina.ru) - not necessary.\n3) Read cdkey.txt if you need to add/refill your cdkey - not necessary.\n3) Copy &quot;Diablo 2.lnk&quot; from folder to your desktop and run it.\n   If you unpacked archive to another folder, change path to file &quot;d2m.exe&quot; in shortcut properties.\n   &quot;d2m.exe&quot; is a multiloader for version 1.13 and allows to run many copies of D2 at the same time.\n4) Also you can change desired flags in shortcut properties\n   (mine is &quot;-w -ns -skiptobnet -direct -npl -noplugins -noscript&quot;, for example &quot;-ns&quot; means &quot;no sound&quot;).\n5) If you need version different from 1.13c, you can use LodRepair.exe - it reset your game to LoD v. 1.07.\n   LODPatch_111b.exe, LODPatch_112a.exe, LODPatch_113c.exe - patches up to 1.11b, 1.12a and 1.13c respectively.\n   Downloaded from http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/\n6) If you need maphack - unzip archive &quot;d2hackmap 1.12.zip&quot; or &quot;d2mr-1.13c.zip&quot; in any folder and run .exe file\n   (in Vista and Windows 7 you must select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;).\n   Beware because it is forbidden on most servers and may lead you to ban of all your accounts.\n\nNotes:\n1. If you use Windows 7 on high-end PC's you may see graphical problems just after loading the game.\n   It's ONLY happens to full-screen mode and visible only on the first screen. After logging into your account all problems disappear.\n   If not, you probably need to mark compatibility options on &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab of d2m.exe or diablo II.exe.\n   Or you can use window-mode like many pro-gamers.\n2. In this configuration I swapped actions for &quot;Alt&quot; and &quot;Space&quot; buttons. It was made because it is more convenient to highlight dropped items. You can change this in &quot;Configure controls&quot;.\n\n\n\nGood luck and have fun on the long way to the 99 level.\nViva la Somalia!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ebb52edddcd6a4ad4d147b5eb01e22f4739260","amp;dn":"Diablo+2+Lord+of+Destruction+v1.13c+%28without+cinematics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73ebb52edddcd6a4ad4d147b5eb01e22f4739260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,235,181,46,221,220,214,164,173,77,20,123,94,176,30,34,244,115,146,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
