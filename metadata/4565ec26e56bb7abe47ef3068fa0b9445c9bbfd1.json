We did our normal stuff to it as we said we brighten the movie along with saturation, contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. The audio is from IMAGINE and aside from the ocassional static and another radio station coming in about 3 or 4 times it's very good better then cam that's for sure so you have been warned. Many thanks to EleKtriKa and IMAGINE. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS\n\nUPLOADER NOTES\nIF THE VIDEO WAS BRIGHTER IT WOULD BE DECENT...AUDIO NOT GREAT BUT BEST OUT SO FAR...I GUESS THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T WAIT...PLEASE COMMENT :) \n\ncredit FLAWL3SS &amp; BDK &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img521/6733/vlcsnap2010083116h20m37.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img521/6733/vlcsnap2010083116h20m37.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img517/1174/vlcsnap2010083116h19m59.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img517/1174/vlcsnap2010083116h19m59.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img812/3672/vlcsnap2010083116h19m23.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img812/3672/vlcsnap2010083116h19m23.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4565ec26e56bb7abe47ef3068fa0b9445c9bbfd1","amp;dn":"Scott+Pilgrim+vs+The+World+TS+XviD-FLAWL3SS%28READ+NOTES%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4565ec26e56bb7abe47ef3068fa0b9445c9bbfd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,101,236,38,229,107,183,171,228,126,243,6,143,160,185,68,92,155,191,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
