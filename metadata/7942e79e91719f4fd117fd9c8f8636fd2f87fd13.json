Stephanie Wang-BrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wo Ai Ni (I Love You) Mommy is the story of Fang Sui Yong, an 8-year-old orphan, and the Sadowskys, the Long Island Jewish family that travels to China to adopt her. Sui Yong is one of 70,000 Chinese children now being raised in the United States. Through her eyes, we witness her struggle with a new identity as she transforms from a timid child into someone that no one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ neither her new family nor she ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ could have imagined. A co-production of American Documentary/POV and the Diverse Voices Project, presented in association with the Center for Asian American Media, with funding provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 830 MiB for 1h 26mn 28s 200ms\nSource            : PBS\nCodec             : DivX\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 200 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 360 (1.778) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7942e79e91719f4fd117fd9c8f8636fd2f87fd13","amp;dn":"POV.S23E10.Wo.Ai.Ni.%28I+Love+You%29.Mommy.HDTV.DivX-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7942e79e91719f4fd117fd9c8f8636fd2f87fd13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,66,231,158,145,113,159,79,209,23,253,156,143,134,54,253,47,135,253,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
