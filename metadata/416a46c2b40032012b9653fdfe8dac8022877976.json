Unable to leave because his papers aren't in order is Paul Henreid, former pianist, who recently had fought with the Free French. As result he and his wife, played with much feeling by Eleanor Parker, take to the gas pipe, both wanting to die together. Meantime, in an air raid the bus carrying others to the evacuation ship are killed.\n\nFrom here the action shifts to a mystery ship which, it finally becomes evident, is bound for the Great Beyond, with Henreid, Parker and the group which had been killed in the bomb raid. Brilliant dialog and excellent performances, as well as thoughtful, imaginative direction by Edward A. Blatt, neatly sustain the interest aboard ship on the long voyage. There is no place in the story for comedy relief.\n\nOn reaching High Olympus and judgement day, Sydney Greenstreet enters the scene as the examiner, taking his new arrivals one by one. His performance is outstanding, and the sequence, though quite lengthy, represents a productional, directional and acting triumph.\n\n\n\n\n\n-------not my rip----------\n-------tv rip by ZenKoan--------\n\nIndex Chunk: Yes\nInterleaved: Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec: 0\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)\nAverage Bitrate Per Sec: 59 kb/s\nSamples Rate: 48000 Hz\nChannels: 1\nBits Per Sample: 0\nSuggestedBufferSize: 480\nSample Size: 0\nVariable Bitrate: Yes (56, 64, 96)\nVIDEO: XVID\nB-VOP: No\nS(GMC)-VOP: No\nQuarterPixel: No\nFrame Size: 640 x 496\nAverage Bitrate Per Sec: 1480 kb/s\nFrames Rate: 23.976\nColor Depth: 12\nTotal Frames: 161088\nSuggestedBufferSize: 63552\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
