From that moment allegations of corruption and the \n         Australian Police have never been far apart.\n\n         By the 1970's many began to suspect that the 16,000 member New \n         South Wales police force - the third largest in the world - was \n         rotten with entrenched corruption. There was talk of high level \n         police protecting drug dealers and trafficking drugs themselves, \n         of police involved in assault, in verballing, in fabricating \n         evidence... even in murder. If true, this was not a case of a few \n         bad apples but a diseased crop - the police were out of control.\n\n         In 1994 an extraordinary confluence of events allowed a now legendary \n         team of corruption fighters to take them on. To do so they unleashed a\n         n investigative model so extreme, it seemed to challenge the very \n         boundaries of justice itself.\n\n         Told by the key players themselves: Independent MP John Hatton, \n         Justice James Wood, Counsels Gary Crooke and John Agius, and \n         Investigator Nigel Hadgkiss, The Inquisition is the story of \n         the Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service that became \n         an international model for battling entrenched corruption. Like \n         The Untouchables, the stakes were high in their unprecedented \n         investigation. For many, it was a matter of life or death.\n\n                                                                         \n                                                                                \n          CAST \n\n\n\t          \t\n\t\t\t\n\n            NOTES               \n\n             \n         \n\n            LOOKING FOR               \n\n\n           - .pl ,.ro ,.hu ,.no ,.cz sites, ask around if you cant find us :D\n           - 10mbit + dump for private usage\n           - TV-DVD / DVDR / x264 suplliers\n\n\n\n            GREETZ      \n\n\n             731 , CHRONO, SYS, AVCHD, AVCDVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560fa9811359ffe4bd1372f9e20616d444d05b46","amp;dn":"The.Inquisition.2010.DOCU.DVDRip.XViD-PFa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560fa9811359ffe4bd1372f9e20616d444d05b46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,15,169,129,19,89,255,228,189,19,114,249,226,6,22,212,68,208,91,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
