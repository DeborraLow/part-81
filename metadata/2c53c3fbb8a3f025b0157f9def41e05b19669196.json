He was signed to a joint venture between Scooter Braun's Schoolboy Music and Steve RifkindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SRC Records. His first professional release was on June 13, 2008, when the DJ Drama and Don Cannon-helmed The GreenHouse Effect Mixtape was released for free via RothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Web site. Roth was featured on the cover of XXL magazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s annual Top 10 Freshmen: Hip-HopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Class ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢09 issue. Roth's debut album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, was released on April 20, 2009\n\nAsher Roth was born and raised in Morrisville, a small town about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia.[1][2][3] His mother, Elizabeth (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e McConnell), is a yoga instructor, and his father, David Roth, is the executive director of a design firm.[4][5][6][7] He attended Pennsbury High School. Growing up, Roth was exposed to little hip-hop in his family, with his parents preferring &quot;The Temptations, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire ... Bruce Springsteen and Dire Straits.&quot; According to Roth:\n\n    The first CD I ever bought was Dave Matthews Band's Crash...That is how suburban I am...I finally got into hip hop in '98 when I heard the Annie sample with Jay-Z....When I wrote my 'A Milli' freestyle, that was me listening to 10 years of hip hop and not relating to it at all. Like, Damn I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sell coke. Damn, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have cars or 25-inch rims. I don't have guns. I finally got to a point where I had the confidence to do this thing myself, and I was making music for me. And it turns out, a lot of people feel the same way I do.[9]\n\nAsher has also stated that:\n\n    &quot;I was always from the outside looking in,&quot; says Roth. &quot;Hip-hop has always been very influential in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“burbs, [but] itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a matter of where we could relate to it. You find a lot of kids that are really confused. You look at them and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dressed out of character. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right. I figured out, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to dress this way, but I can still love hip-hop.&quot;[10]\n\nUpon graduation, Roth entered West Chester University and became an Elementary Education major, while continuing to record verses over other peoplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ beats. During sophomore year, Roth posted some of his verses on his MySpace page and sent a Friend Request to Scooter Braun, an Atlanta-based promoter and former VP of Marketing for Jermaine Dupri's So So Def. One week after speaking to Braun, Roth flew down to Atlanta and was immediately signed by Braun, who subsequently became his manager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c53c3fbb8a3f025b0157f9def41e05b19669196","amp;dn":"Asher+Roth+-+Asleep+in+the+Bread+Aisle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c53c3fbb8a3f025b0157f9def41e05b19669196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,83,195,251,184,163,240,37,176,21,127,157,239,65,224,91,25,102,145,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
