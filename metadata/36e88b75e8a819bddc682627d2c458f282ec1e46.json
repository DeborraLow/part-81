The exhibition, supported by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was one of the first cultural exchanges between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that served as a critical breakthrough to begin the thaw of the Cold War between the two super powers.\n\nOpening in Moscow plays like a travelogue, providing a social document on the cultural divide between 1950s Soviet Union and America. The film is shot in colour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a few black and white interludes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and focuses on the opening of the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. I had expected there to be a little more focus on the logistics behind proposing such an event (I would imagine there wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been some interesting roadblocks during the process) and the planning and construction of the facility. We do see a bit of this in the first part of the film, but the majority of time is spent watching the Russian citizens marvel at the wonders of American life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ via staged demonstrations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and in turn, looking at typical life in Moscow.\n\nMedia Info:\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 579 MiB\nDuration                         : 49mn 20s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 641 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 49mn 20s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.216\nStream size                      : 529 MiB (91%)\n\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 49mn 20s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 45.2 MiB (8%)\n\n\n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/5066/openinginmoscowpennebak.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/5066/openinginmoscowpennebak.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nShare this rare gem!\n19/4/2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e88b75e8a819bddc682627d2c458f282ec1e46","amp;dn":"Opening+in+Moscow+%281959%2C++D+A+Pennebaker%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e88b75e8a819bddc682627d2c458f282ec1e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,232,139,117,232,168,25,189,220,104,38,39,210,196,88,242,130,236,30,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
