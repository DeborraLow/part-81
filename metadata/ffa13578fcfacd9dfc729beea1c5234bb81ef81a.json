It used to be available on the net, but has since been taken down, probably due to pressure from Islamic radicals who do not want the Qur'an exposed to critical analysis.\n\nWhen released, this documentary received high reviews from scholars and others involved in Islamic studies.\n\nThis is low res 320x176 video, but the quality is quite good despite the low res.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa13578fcfacd9dfc729beea1c5234bb81ef81a","amp;dn":"Qur%5C%27an+UK+channel+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa13578fcfacd9dfc729beea1c5234bb81ef81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,161,53,120,252,250,205,157,252,114,155,238,161,197,35,75,184,30,248,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
