This is one of the best mystery films I have    \n    seen in recent years. In particular, the primary characters are the      \n    familys two brothers, played by Kase and Masaki Okada. We learn         \n    later in the film that in truth, one of the children, is illegitimate    \n    by the result of the hands of a brutal rapist.                           \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
