Sad CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (5:02)\n02. Dig A Deeper Hole (3:21)\n03. Rock City Road (3:28)\n04. Roll River Roll (4:05)\n05. Agadaga Dooley (3:09)\n06. No Turnin' Back (6:06)\n07. Cowboy's Dream (4:24)\n08. Bazaraza Bound (8:43)\n\nThough short-lived, Holy Moses came up with one of the psychedelic eraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most enduring hard rock one-offs, packed with strong songs and blazing guitar parts by Ted Spelios.\n\nThe late-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s and early-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s musical landscape is marred with one-shot albums.\nThousands of bands took a stab, failed to hit the jugular, and disappeared quietly into the night, but only the good lord knows why such a fate was handed down to Holy Moses.\nThe band's lone, eponymous release has all the ingredients of a bonafide classic.\nRecorded at Jimi Hendrix's newly built Electric Lady studio and produced by Kim King (Lothar &amp; The Hand People) and Mike Esposito (The Blues Magoos), it sounds just as fresh and full today as it must have back then.\nBilly Batson -- which may not be his real name, since it's the mild-mannered moniker of Captain Marvel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ wrote all the songs with a clear sense of humor and an undeniable swagger.\nHis roughhouse storytelling was propelled to another dimension by the six-string prowess of one Ted Spelios: a man who is said to have impressed a young Bruce Springsteen during his brief stint in another one-album band called Kangaroo.\n&quot;No Turnin' Back&quot; is a sure mixtape highlight. Spelios' shredding is righteous, totally supporting the saloon piano and a tale of love -- half way out the door -- as moaned by Batson.\nWith a hint of southern revival cutting through the sombre barroom rowdiness, Billy's husky voice fleetingly wanes under the struggle, sounding like a clear influence on Kings Of Leon and other like-minded bands that would crop up decades later.\n&quot;Roll River Roll&quot; hits roughly the same area, but with a church organ instead of piano.\nThe plinking tone that occasionally surfaces, care of Ted, sounds like Soundgarden's &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; or something Tom Morello might use.\nTypically, though, the album rambles through rockin' psychedelic R&amp;B numbers, the band's bread and butter.\nThey were as good as anyone at the up-tempo numbers, yet the two dismal tunes are the most thoroughly engaging, the ones where they let their guard down and truly emote.\nI cannot fathom why Holy Moses!! wasn't a gold record in its time, or why it's taken so long to appear on CD.\nDidn't the world need a drunker Canned Heat (check &quot;Agadaga Dooley&quot; and you'll know)? I guess not, because the LP fizzled on release and the band followed suit shortly thereafter.\nSadly, Ted Spelios never got a third chance to fulfill his awesome promise and crumbled with mental problems, eventually becoming, -- according to legend -- a wine-making monk.\nHe could have easily been the next Robin Trower; the East Village already considered him the best guitarist alive next to Hendrix. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d930397a9bb4b85cfabe1eae30ec66d1b2b255","amp;dn":"Holy+Moses+-+Holy+Moses%21%21+%281971%2F2006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d930397a9bb4b85cfabe1eae30ec66d1b2b255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,217,48,57,122,155,180,184,92,250,190,30,174,48,236,102,209,178,178,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
