PLEASE do not think of me badly, but I live in Thailand where there is the worst provision of the internet of anywhere I know. The quickest speeds are (supposed to be) 6 Mb! I am lucky to get 450 Kb - indeed - normally around 80 - 180 Kb! So, HD files, at more than 3 Gigs are just to big to download in any sort of realistic time!\n\nFor that reason, I am providing - with a time lag I'm afraid - normal low res files, which I, and perhaps others, wil find more realistic for their needs.\n\nTurkey Grand Prix Race in Standard Definition\n\nRace 4: Turkish Grand Prix, Istanbul Park Circuit\n\nRecording Source: BBC One HD\n\nJake Humphrey, Martin Brundle, David Coulthard &amp; Eddie Jordan present the F1 Race coverage to the 4th Race meeting of the 2011 Formula One season, The Turkish Grand Prix, from the Instanbul Park Curcuit.\n\n\nCheers ...
