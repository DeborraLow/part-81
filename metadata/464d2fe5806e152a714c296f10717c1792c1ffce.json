Three years later, they had vanished. Investigating America's oldest missing-persons case, Josh Bernstein flies high above Roanoke Island in a powered para-glider; climbs and cores a cypress tree to study the climate conditions the settlers faced; participates in an American-Indian powwow; and learns to cook as the local 16th-century natives once did.
