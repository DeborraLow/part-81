The finger was pointed at greedy traders, cowardly legislators and clueless home buyers, but many devils helped bring hell to the economy.\n\nAll The Devils Are Here goes back several decades to explore the motivations of everyone from CEOs and politicians to anonymous lenders, borrowers and Wall Street traders. It exposes the hidden role of companies including AIG and Goldman Sachs. It delves into the powerful mythology of homeownership. And it proves that the crisis ultimately wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about finance at all; it was about human nature.\n\nBethany McLeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Smartest Guys in the Room was the best Enron book on a crowded shelf. All the Devils Are Here will be remembered for finally making sense of the meltdown.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Amazon)\n\nThe best business book of the year ... a masterpiece. (Huffington Post )\n\nWhen the financial crisis of this decade is being taught in business schools, All the Devils Are Here could be the textbook. (Time )\n\nGreat stuff (Financial Times )\n\nImpressive. [A] balanced and balanced and complex portrayal of the roots of the crisis.
