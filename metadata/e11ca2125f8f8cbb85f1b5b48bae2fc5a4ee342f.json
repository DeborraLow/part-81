Thanks m8ty\n\nNOTES:\n\nIMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Hangover 2 V2\n\nOk here we go with our second version of hangover 2 and what a nightmare it was,but all good in the\nend so we think anyways lol.\nRight first of the main body of the video is from a nice 720p cam and was dam good but had some\ncamera movement and missing a few minutes between change overs.\nNow for those minutes, we replaced them with V1, about 14 minutes in total.\nRight work done ....well firstly we needed to cut the 720p several pieces and rotate,crop and resize each part\ndifferently aswell as the normal contrast,brightness,sharpness etc....\nBut by doing this the AR was off on some parts and bang on with others,so we've gone with a AR which is pretty\ndecent for all parts, but at times may be a bit stretched/smooshed but nothing major and doesnt last long.....\nfigured it was best to over crop a few seconds than have the picture shift from camera movement,\nalthough there is some movement but not as much as there would have been..........\nAlso after doing that we then needed to cut V1 video for the missing scenes and redo them to match the same\nAR and video stats as the rest so we could append them together.....\nSo, from start to about 6 minutes 45 seconds then again from 56:16 to 1.02.29 all from V1......\nAudio is some sweet LiNE which we synced filtered and remuxed to our encode\n\nAnyway have to say it came out dam nice considering the source so enjoy this one funny as fook film  \n\n\nV1 to V2 comparison shots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/61115&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/61115&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSCREENS:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/78458158489255579745.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/78458158489255579745.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/71322502663831112072.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/71322502663831112072.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77428784311590024413.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77428784311590024413.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11ca2125f8f8cbb85f1b5b48bae2fc5a4ee342f","amp;dn":"The+Hangover+II+2011+TS+V2+READNFO+LiNE+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11ca2125f8f8cbb85f1b5b48bae2fc5a4ee342f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,28,162,18,95,143,140,187,133,241,181,180,139,174,47,197,164,238,52,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
