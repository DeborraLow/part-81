In other words, it catches the group at a crossroads, unsure quite how to proceed. Taking the epic, layered &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; as a starting point (the single, which is darker and more dance-oriented than the remainder of the album, was haphazardly inserted into the middle of the album for its American release), the group crafts more sweeping, mid-tempo numbers, whether it's the melancholy &quot;That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore&quot; or the failed, self-absorbed protest of the title track. \n\nReleased: 1985\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nLabel: Sire\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n  1.
