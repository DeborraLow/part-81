We get to see the current impact of depression with her second husband, its impact on her now 13 year old daughter. There are scenes of medical and psychological intervention, her befriending a music student (with a past) both as a professor and later as companions who support each other. There is ultimately the professors having to make difficult decisions regarding her decision, her treatment, and resolution of her relationship with her husband, daughter, and now her female friend with mixed results.\n\n[img]http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/9937/49189276.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/8762/10919677.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/6672/72198930.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/175/E4FA621861A51E09B44842B10595E2EB.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\nGreetz to Fabreezy ,Imagine ,Flawl3ss,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom ,Tank66 ,Xclusive66 ,Prism ,Noir ,BDK ,TA and all other uploaders who serve the community\n\n\nSource used :\n\nHelen 2010 NTSC Retail DVDR-TeBuGG - Thanks \n\nLeft AR untouched just cropped out the black borders and made this XviD .Had to lose most of ending credit i needed the encode to finish i was on way out (honest) \n\nEnjoy !\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9668e6b4a242e44dce644fa76fafab6a1ea6bc0f","amp;dn":"Helen+2009+XviD+DvDrip+SAFCuk009%2BFabreezy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9668e6b4a242e44dce644fa76fafab6a1ea6bc0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,104,230,180,162,66,228,77,206,100,79,167,111,175,171,106,30,166,188,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
