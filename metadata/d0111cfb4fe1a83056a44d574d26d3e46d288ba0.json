He visits his Uncle Jimmy in    \n    Accra. Jimmy is the son of Hugh's grandfather, William    \n    Reginald Phillips. He tells Hugh that his grandfather    \n    was a successful businessman, setting up a trading        \n    company. So where did he get the money to do this?         \n    Jimmy reveals that William's mother was Anna Kamerling,   \n    who was half-Dutch and lived in a town called Elmina.    \n                                                              \n    Hugh travels to Elmina to find the Kamerling House. He     \n    discovers a new relative, his Aunt Gertrude, who tells    \n    Hugh that his grandfather's half brother became the      \n    chief of Abee. Hugh remembers that his mother used to     \n    call herself the Duchess of Abee. What did she mean?       \n    Hugh travels to Abee and meets the new chief, who tells   \n    him an interesting tale which could solve the mystery.   \n                                                              \n    Hugh decides to travel to the Netherlands to find out      \n    if he can go any further with the Dutch side of his       \n    family. Here he encounters a whole line of the family    \n    tree he never knew he had. He uncovers a love story       \n    across time and race that is a microcosm of 19th           \n    century coastal life on the Gold Coast.                   \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0111cfb4fe1a83056a44d574d26d3e46d288ba0","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.UK.Hugh.Quarshie.S07E08.720p.HDTV.x264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0111cfb4fe1a83056a44d574d26d3e46d288ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,17,28,251,79,225,168,48,86,164,77,87,77,38,211,228,109,40,139,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
