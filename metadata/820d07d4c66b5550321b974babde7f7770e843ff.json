The album was the band's last studio album before their 1988 disbanding until the recently released new album, titled Move Like This.\n\nThe Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&amp;R head, in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978, The Cars debut album was called a &quot;genuine rock masterpiece&quot; by allmusic. Probably the most successful and well known song from the album &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJ's, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977. The Cars have mentioned this numerous times including in their &quot;last&quot; interview in June 2000. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described The Cars' musical style by saying: &quot;they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;\n\nAllmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented on their style saying &quot;the Cars were nevertheless inspired by proto-punk, garage rock, and bubblegum pop.&quot;\n\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 &quot;I'm saying never and you can count on that.&quot; Bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The remaining members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which was released on May 10, 2011, and a tour started on the same day.\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_to_Door_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_to_Door_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n\n\nTrack list:\n(01) The Cars - Leave or Stay.flac\n(02) The Cars - You Are the Girl.flac\n(03) The Cars - Double Trouble.flac\n(04) The Cars - Fine Line.flac\n(05) The Cars - Everything You Say.flac\n(06) The Cars - Ta Ta Wayo Wayo.flac\n(07) The Cars - Strap Me In.flac\n(08) The Cars - Coming Up You.flac\n(09) The Cars - Wound Up On You.flac\n(10) The Cars - Go Away.flac\n(11) The Cars - Door to Door.flac\n*includes complete CD covers folder\n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \nFormat                           : FLAC\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 946 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 19.9 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
