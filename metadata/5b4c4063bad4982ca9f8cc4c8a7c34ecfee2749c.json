We really want to know if our customers value this and whether we should carry on doing it in the future. Thanks!**\n\n---\n\nNow includes a whole new game mode, &quot;10 kicks&quot;, for free of course!\n\n---\n\nBeat the keeper and defence from seemingly impossible free kick positions. Skill shots such as rebounding the ball into the goal off the woodwork earn extra points, whilst scoring goals in succession raises your score multiplier.\n\nExperience complete and instant control over the trajectory of the ball in a single flick. There is no unrealistic &quot;drawing the path of the ball&quot; to curl the kick, just simply flick the ball off-centre as the pros kick it in real life and let the ball aerodynamics do the rest! Direction, power, and curve is instantly under your command.\n\nAll this control would amount to nothing without a highly accurate physics simulation. We used the excellent Bullet Physics library to model the aerodynamics of the ball, in particular the swerve of the ball due to the Magnus effect - the physical phenomenon explaining the dramatic swerve and dip of a football when the kicker adds spin.\n\n- iPad and iPhone 4 Retina Display support for HD gameplay\n- Online leaderboards to compete against your friends and worldwide. \n- OpenFeint, Facebook and Twitter integration.\n- Earn Achievements with your skills (online connection required).\n- Three game modes, each with online leaderboards\n- Kick Flick Academy will teach you how to bend the ball like a pro\n- Unique full 3D neon art style.\n- Realistic physics simulation using the Bullet Physics Engine\n- 3D menus and interface.\n- Option to turn music off and play your own music in the background.\nWhat's new in Version 1.0.3\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â° Now supports both iPad and iPhone 4 Retina Display for HD gameplay.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â° New game mode &quot;10 Kicks&quot;.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â° Flick power accuracy is now calculated accurately for even more precise control. Players of older versions will take time to get used to it, but trust us, it's worth it![/b][/color]\n[color=violet][b]* You will firstly have to Jailbreak your iphone, which installs Cydia. \n\n\n* Then to install cracked apps you will need to: \n\n* Go into Cydia on Iphone/Ipod touch\n\n* Go to manage, then sources\n\n* Add: (Http://) cydia.hackulo.us/\n\n* Next search for appsync (Mipatch will not work with 3.0) and install onto iphone\n\n* Next add the app to itunes\n\n* Sync your iphone to itunes and add the application\n\n JOB DONE[/b][/color] \n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9931/coollogocom3072999443.png[/img]\n[img]http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/7097/6sdez7.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2538/2s9d1cg.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4c4063bad4982ca9f8cc4c8a7c34ecfee2749c","amp;dn":"Kick+Flick+Soccer+2010+v1.0.3+%28Iphone-Ipod-Ipad%29+%28KING+AYUB%29++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4c4063bad4982ca9f8cc4c8a7c34ecfee2749c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,76,64,99,186,212,152,44,169,248,204,76,138,124,52,236,254,226,116,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
