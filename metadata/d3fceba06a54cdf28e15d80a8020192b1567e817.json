His music can be categorized as Alternative/ Folk Rock/ Indie and he's quite popular in Norway and even in Europe, but still relatively unknown in North America.  His songs have been played on TV shows and movies, and On Your Side was his first full length album and received critical acclaim.\n\nI had a difficult time finding this album in full.  It's MP3 quality and a mix of 192Kbps or 256Kbps.  It's the full re-release with extra tracks.  I hope you all enjoy it and seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3fceba06a54cdf28e15d80a8020192b1567e817","amp;dn":"Magnet+-+On+Your+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3fceba06a54cdf28e15d80a8020192b1567e817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,252,235,160,106,84,205,242,142,21,216,10,128,32,25,43,21,103,232,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
