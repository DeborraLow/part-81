Treat activation just like Win 7 SP1 Enterprise (AKA use your KMS activator/method of choice).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aeda3adedd6eac37bd0c72056c7a6249efc3fd6","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+8+Build+7850+M1+leak+TIMEBOMB+REMOVE+TOOL+x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aeda3adedd6eac37bd0c72056c7a6249efc3fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,237,163,173,237,214,234,195,123,208,199,32,86,199,166,36,158,252,63,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
