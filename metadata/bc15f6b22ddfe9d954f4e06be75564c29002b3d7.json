Lindsey, piloting one of the rig's three mini-subs, experiences the same type of power loss that the Montana did. While searching a compartment on the Montana, Bud's partner, Jammer, the rig crew's biggest member, sees a strange, glowing creature and panics. When he tries to escape the chamber, he damages the valve on his breathing apparatus and begins to convulse. Bud and his comrades are able to save Jammer, but the incident puts him in a coma.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc15f6b22ddfe9d954f4e06be75564c29002b3d7","amp;dn":"The+Abyss+Uncut+R6+SE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc15f6b22ddfe9d954f4e06be75564c29002b3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,21,246,178,45,223,233,217,84,244,224,107,231,85,100,194,144,2,179,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
