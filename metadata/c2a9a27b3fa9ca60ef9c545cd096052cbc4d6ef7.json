Hayley Williams\n  \n\nAbout the Artist\nBobby Ray Simmons, Jr. (born November 15, 198, also known by his stage name B.o.B, is an American musician and record producer. He is currently signed under the labels of Grand Hustle Records, Rebel Rock Entertainment and Atlantic Records. He is currently gaining huge international success, as his first two singles (\\&quot;Nothin\\' on You\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Airplanes\\&quot;) both reached the top spot in the U.K., while also scoring a number one in the U.S. with debut single \\&quot;Nothin\\' on You\\&quot;.\n\nHayley Nichole Williams (born December 27, 198 is an American singer and songwriter. She is the lead vocalist and keyboardist of Paramore.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\\&quot;Airplanes\\&quot; is the second official and third overall single from B.o.B\\'s debut studio album, B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray. The track features Paramore\\'s lead singer, Hayley Williams and was produced by Alex Da Kid with DJ Frank E receiving a co-production credit on the song. The music and chorus were written by Kinetics &amp; One Love. The song was released to urban radio on April 27, 2010. The song reached number one in New Zealand, and also in the United Kingdom (from downloads alone of 75,892) as well as the top three in Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United States.\n\n\nPlot\n\nA music video has already been shot with Williams. B.o.B shot his scenes for the video in April, but Williams was only able to shoot her parts after the end of Paramore\\'s spring tour, so they were never in the same room during filming. The music video, directed by Hiro Murai, premiered on iTunes on Tuesday June 15, 2010. The video features several frames of B.o.B rapping his verses in a party setting, on stage, and room filled with lights and occasional song lyrics while Hayley Williams sings the hook in a light filled room and walking through photographs. Jim Jonsin makes a cameo appearance.\n\n\n\nLyrics\n\n[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars?\nI could really use a wish right now\nWish right now\nWish right now\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars?\nI could really use a wish right now\nWish right now\nWish right now\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nYa, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish\nTo go back to a place much simpler than this\n\\'Cause after all the partyin\\' and smashin\\' and crashin\\'\nAnd all the glitz and the glam and the fashion\nAnd all the pandemonium and all the madness\nThere comes a time where you fade to the blackness\nAnd when you starin\\' at that phone in your lap\nAnd you hopin\\' but them people never call you back\nBut that\\'s just how the story unfolds\nYou get another hand soon after you fold\nAnd when your plans unravel in the sand\nWhat would you wish for if you had one chance?\nSo airplane, airplane, sorry I\\'m late\nI\\'m on my way so don\\'t close that gate\nIf I don\\'t make that then I\\'ll switch my flight\nAnd I\\'ll be right back at it by the end of the night\n\n[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)\nI could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)\nI could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nYa, ya, somebody take me back to the days\nBefo\\' this was a job, befo\\' I got paid\nBefo\\' it ever mattered what I had in my bank\nYa, back when I was tryin\\' to get a tip at Subway\nAnd back when I was rappin\\' for the hell of it\nBut nowadays we rappin\\' to stay relevant\nI\\'m guessin\\' that if we can make some wishes outta\\' airplanes\nThen maybe oh maybe I\\'ll go back to the days\nBefo\\' the politics that we call the rap game\nAnd back when ain\\'t nobody listen to my mixtape\nAnd back befo\\' I tried to cover up my slang\nBut this is fo\\' the hater, what\\'s up Bobby Ray?\nSo can I get a wish\nTo end the politics\nAnd get back to the music\nThat started this shit?\nSo here I stand and then again I say\nI\\'m hopin\\' we can make some wishes outta\\' airplanes\n\n[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)\nI could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nCan we pretend that airplanes\nIn the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)\nI could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\nWish right now (Wish right now)\n\n[Outro: B.o.B]\nI could really use a wish right now\n(I could really use a wish right now)\nI-I-I could really use a wish right now\n(I could really use a wish right now)\nLike, like, like shootin\\' stars\n(Like shootin\\' stars)\nI-I-I-I could really use a wish right now\n(I could really use a wish right now)\nA wish, a wish right now\n(A wish right now)\n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 60.1 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 2s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2,766 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nDuration                         : 3mn 2s\nBit rate                         : 2,434 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1,280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 30.000 fps\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nStream size                      : 52.9 MiB (88%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nDuration                         : 3mn 2s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 6.95 MiB (12%)\nInterleave, duration             : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a9a27b3fa9ca60ef9c545cd096052cbc4d6ef7","amp;dn":"Airplanes+-+B.o.B.+feat.+Hayley+Williams+%28HD+720p%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a9a27b3fa9ca60ef9c545cd096052cbc4d6ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,169,162,123,63,169,202,96,239,156,84,92,208,150,5,44,188,77,110,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
