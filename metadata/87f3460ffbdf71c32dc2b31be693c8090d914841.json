In the first, &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jiggle and Mr. Sly,&quot; Scooter the Carrot and Larry investigate the appearances of a flashy, disco-dancing gourd in the dark streets of London. Then Larry and a female friend team up for the Silly Song &quot;Sport Utility Vehicle,&quot; which pokes fun at preppy SUV owners who dream of using their rugged vehicles for more than just trips to the donut shop. After the song, the title segment follows (in Dr. Seuss-style rhyming verse) the morality tale of a winged creature called a Snoodle, who learns his true self-worth during a mountaintop journey. As a special bonus, the similarly-Seussian &quot;The Story of Flibber-o-loo,&quot; from _VeggieTales: Are You My Neighbor (1999) (V)_ , ends the video.\n\nDirector:Marc Vulcano\nWriters:Mike Nawrocki, Phil Vischer\nStars:Mike Nawrocki, Jim Poole and Phil Vischer ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f3460ffbdf71c32dc2b31be693c8090d914841","amp;dn":"2004.VeggieTales.A.Snoodle%5C%27s.Tale.%26.the.Story.of.Flibber.o-Loo.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f3460ffbdf71c32dc2b31be693c8090d914841","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,243,70,15,251,223,113,195,45,194,179,27,230,147,200,9,13,145,72,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
