He later admitted it was a publicity stunt.\n\nOther than those rumours, Chad Beloin\\'s entire career is 100% true, about his Deep Into The Nation Tour, I know it\\'s happening because I\\'ve got tickets to the first show, plus I\\'ll definitely be watching the Livestream performance. I hope he finds this, cause if he does, Chad, please don\\'t delete this... it\\'s going to do you a HUGE favor, as well as, could you please do a few rehearsals on Livestream? I\\'d love to watch!\n\nABOUT THE TORRENT:\n\nThis torrent includes Chad Beloin\\'s albums \\&quot;Home Free: Deluxe Edition\\&quot; and \\&quot;Deep Into The Life of Chad Beloin Part One\\&quot;. In addition, it includes the mixtape \\&quot;Love Is Us\\&quot;, and Chad Beloin\\'s resource album, \\&quot;Love Is Us Instrumentals\\&quot;.
