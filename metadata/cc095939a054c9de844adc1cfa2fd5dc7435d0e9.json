[Original]\n\nWindows 7 32-bit with full 4 GB or 8 GB RAM support\nDo not work - say many people. And it still goes.\n\nIn the Internet often haunts the statement a 32-bit operating system can technically only managed a maximum of 4 GB of RAM. This is wrong and Microsoft is even evidence itself, that with the special version of &quot;Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition&quot; it worked:\n\n[code]http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc758523(WS.10).aspx[/code]\n\n64-GB RAM Maximum\n... the 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition supports up to 64 GB of RAM on x86-based computers. ... \n\nThe kernel of the 32-bit version of Windows 7 has only a lock, which prevents access to more memory. More dramatically is this lock in the 32-bit version of Windows 7 Starter Edition: There the prohibition is much more rigorous and it only allows access to 2 GB of RAM:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/4GB-Computer-info-overwiev-Starter-unpatched.png[/img]\n\n\nIn the 32-bit version of Windows 7 from 4 GB usually only 3.25 -3.5 GB of RAM are usable:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/4GB-Computer-info-overwiev-unpatched.png[/img]\n\n\nIn general many people believe this &quot;not usable&quot; RAM\nis occupied by the graphic card RAM:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/4GB-Resource-Monitor-unpatched.png[/img]\n\n\nThe German computer magazine c't has made a test\nwith different graphic cards (c't 23/2009, page 165):\n\nGraphic card RAM Usable RAM from 4 GB \n0 MB 3.5 GB \n128 MB 3.5 GB \n256 MB 3.25 GB \n512 MB 3.25 GB \n1024 MB 3.25 GB \n\nThese results are completely incomprehensible. Why is with no video card (0 MB, connection via Remote Desktop) 512 MB RAM blocked? Why blocked a graphic card with 128 MB also 512 MB RAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and not 128 MB? And why blocked a graphic card with 1024 MB &quot;only&quot; 750 MB?\n\nThe Russian Programmers Group &quot;staforce&quot; has written a small program witch removes the lock in the kernel of the 32-bit version of Windows 7. &quot;ICE Technologie&quot; has translate this program into English. The program automatically makes a copy of the kernel file &quot;ntkrnlpa.exe&quot; and saves the copy as separate file &quot;ntkrlICE.exe&quot;. Then the program removes the lock in the copied file &quot;ntkrlICE.exe&quot; and integrates the new kernel file as an extra boot menu entry in the Windows 7 boot menu. So then you have the option to start Windows 7 either as usual with the original kernel file &quot;ntkrnlpa.exe&quot; or with the modified kernel file &quot;ntkrlICE.exe&quot;.\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/Info-to-4-GB-Kernel-Patch.png[/img]\n\n\nWith such a patched (modified) kernel the 32 bit version of Windows 7\nsuddenly can use almost the entire 4 GB of RAM:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/4GB-Resource-Monitor-patched.png[/img]\n\n\nFor these screen shots a 32 MB onboard graphic card is used. So 32 MB is really &quot;hardware reserved&quot;. The rest of 2 MB is reserved for I/O ports (USB port, serial-, parallel port, etc.).\n\nAnd even 8 GB of RAM are now no longer a problem. \nThe original kernel still reports that 4898 MB are &quot;Hardware Reserved&quot; - what hardware?\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/8Gb-Resource-Monitor-unpatched.png[/img]\n\n\nThe patched kernel then reports correct that only 34 MB is &quot;Hardware Reserved&quot;:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/8Gb-Resource-Monitor-patched.png[/img]\n\n\n\nThe RAM limit of the 32-bit version of Windows 7 is therefore 64 GB - like Microsoft describes for the &quot;Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition&quot; (see above). More extensive details - still from Vista-times - see here by Geoff Chappell.\n\n[code]http://www.geoffchappell.com/viewer.htm?doc=notes/windows/license/memory.htm[/code]\n\nThe patch\n\nThe small program &quot;4GB-RAMPatch.exe&quot; patches the kernel and removes the kernel lock:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/4-GB-Ram-Kernel-Patch-en.png[/img]\n\n\n\nThe program makes automatically a copy of the kernel file, then removes the lock and integrates the new kernel file as an extra boot menu entry in the Windows 7 boot menu. So then you have the option to start Windows 7, either as usual with the original kernel file or with the modified kernel file.\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/bootmenu-en.png[/img]\n\n\nThe patch program does not need to install - it runs as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; program; e.g. directly from a USB stick. And it installs no background program.\n\n\n\nThe patch has two small but treatable side effects:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Because Windows 7 observed the changes the kernel can not boot normally. For the Microsoft programmers who often times work with patched kernel Microsoft has built in a boot parameter - an additional switch: &quot;testsigning = Yes&quot;). So they can test their patched kernels. With this switch the patched kernel can start easily.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢But this switch leads to the fact that on the desktop background, lower right corner (above the clock) a hint (&quot;Watermark&quot;) is displayed:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/Watermark.png[/img]\n\n\nTo remove this &quot;watermark&quot; you can use the button &quot;Remove Watermark&quot;:\n\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/Remove-Watermark.png[/img]\n\n\nThen you should reboot.\n\nTo change the boot menu you can start the Windows 7 program &quot;msconfig&quot;:\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/start-msconfig.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.unawave.de/medien/Windows-7/Tipps/32-Bit-RAM-Sperre/msconfig-en.png[/img]\n\n\nOn the tab &quot;Boot&quot; you can specify:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Which boot menu entry to be booted by default (if the user does not interact).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢How long should the Start menu appear.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢And you can delete one or the other boot menu entry.\nHowever, you should not remove the boot menu entry for the original kernel. Because there are some very few programs that do not get along with as much RAM as the kernel patch makes available. Then you can always reboot the original kernel.\n\nTo remove the patch you only need remove the start Menu entry with &quot;msconfig&quot; (you can start the program &quot;msconfig&quot; when you enter in the search box in the start menu &quot;msconfig&quot;). The boot menu then will no longer appear. Because as long as only one menu item is available, no boot menu appears. The copied, patched kernel file &quot;ntkrlICE.exe&quot; in the folder &quot;C:\\Windows\\system32&quot; can also be safely deleted.\n\nIn a Command Prompt with admin rights you can see with the command\n&quot;bcdedit&quot; the new boot menu entry in detail:\n\n \n\nThe text that appears in the boot menu can be found under &quot;description&quot;. \n&quot;testsigning = Yes&quot;  allows the patched kernel to start despite modification. \nThe copied and modified kernel is called &quot;ntkrlICE.exe&quot;. \nWith &quot;pae = ForceEnable&quot; the address extension for the RAM is activated.\n\nNote: I have not tested it and it does NOT have any viruses but some antivirus apps may find it is infected.\nUse at your own risk! I suggest testing it in another computer in separate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc095939a054c9de844adc1cfa2fd5dc7435d0e9","amp;dn":"Windows+7+32+bit+patch+to+support+4+GB+or+more%21+%5BOriginal%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc095939a054c9de844adc1cfa2fd5dc7435d0e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,9,89,57,160,84,201,222,132,74,220,28,250,47,213,220,116,53,208,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
