Verve release more than a dozen albums from the Fest, resulting in a chronicle of some of the greatest live performances in the history of Jazz. \n\nJoin the Newport Jazz Festival in celebrating the 50th Anniversary of this special summer, with this reissue of Oscar Peterson's Trio with Roy Eldridge, Sonny Stitt, and Jo Jones &quot;At Newport&quot;.\n\nThe Oscar Peterson trio of the 50s -- both by itself, and augmented by some great horn work too -- all recorded live at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1957! Side one of the album features the group alone -- Oscar on piano, Herb Ellis on guitar, and Ray Brown on bass -- all in that perfectly fluid drumless groove the group handled so greatly at the time -- leaping and soaring, always with a rhythmic pulse that was all their own. Side two features the group expanded to a sextet -- drummer Jo Jones added in for rhythm, plus Roy Eldridge on trumpet and Sonny Stitt on both alto and tenor sax. These tracks have a slightly looser feel -- more in some of the Verve studio jam modes, with some nice room for solos from the horn players! Titles include &quot;Will You Still be Mine&quot;, &quot;Joy Spring&quot;, &quot;Gal In Calico&quot;, &quot;52nd Street Theme&quot;, &quot;Monitor Blues&quot;, &quot;Willow Weep For Me&quot;, &quot;Autumn In New York&quot;, and &quot;Roy's Son&quot;.\n\nOscar Peterson - At Newport Live Tracks:\n01 Will You Still Be Mine?\n02 Joy Spring\n03 Gal in Calico \n04 52nd Street Theme \n05 Jo Jones Introduction\n06 Monitor Blues\n07 Willow Weep for Me \n08 Autumn in New York\n09 Roy's Son","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e807a2676d512828890d612b16b47df96eeaf3c4","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+-+At+Newport+Live+%282007%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e807a2676d512828890d612b16b47df96eeaf3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,7,162,103,109,81,40,40,137,13,97,43,22,180,125,249,110,234,243,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
