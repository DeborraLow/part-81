I needed the cutscenes for some video editing but all the available versions on the Internet were low-quality, over-converted pieces of s**t.  These videos are lossless to the point of obsession.  To ensure that there was 100% quality retention, I did accordingly:\n\n1) Extracted .pss cutscene files directly from the game disc.\n2) Extracted .m2v (video) and .wav (audio) from each of the cutscenes.\n3) Used TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress to combine the .m2v and .wav files into a readily-usable .mpg file.\n\nSorry for the .mpg files but this was necessary to preserve the quality.  Converting to a more generic filetype, such as .avi, would've resulted in a loss-of-quality, something I was keen to avoid.\n\nUse for your own purposes without restrictions.  Cheers mateys!\n\n-=-=Info=-=-\n\nFormat: MPEG II (.mpg)\nLanguage: English\nNumber of Videos: 11\nTotal Size: ~1.60 GB\n\n** Please seed until your ratio is at least 1.50.
