Emerging from early coffeehouses and Northern Ontario bluesbands, to festivals and concert halls, Ken has been playing professionally since the late 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. He has a reputation as a dynamic, moving performer, mixing hot slide fingerstyle acoustic blues with original songs based on his travels and encounters.\n\nAlthough Ken is as comfortable playing a house concert in your living room as playing on main stage, recent performances have included Edmonton Folk Festival, Calgary Folk Festival, Saskatoon Jazz Festival, and Vancouver Island Musicfest.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d6feb35e49965dc28f670fa6186246c07d69bb","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Ken+Hamm+-+Galvanised%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d6feb35e49965dc28f670fa6186246c07d69bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,214,254,179,94,73,150,93,194,143,103,15,166,24,98,70,192,125,105,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
