WeÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re finally releasing our new record Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“What Keeps You BreathingÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\ntomorrow! We know it's a real cliche thing to say but it feels bloody good to\nbe releasing what we think is our best stuff yet! A lot of hard work has gone\ninto these 11 new songs so we hope you spend just a much time listening to\nthem as we have writing them!\n\nYou probably already know but our album is being bought out by a whole gang of\nfriendsÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Lockjaw Records, No Reason Records, Fond Of Life Records, Bad Mood\nRecords, Funtime Records and Shield Recordings, itÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real group effort and\nit's good to be teaming up with such gentlemen! The album is going to be\navailable for very cheap and should be all over in the coming weeks! There\nwill also be the release of the record on 12Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the coming weeks, more\ndetails on that soon, but for now, get yourself off redtube, get yourself an\nearly night and go get our new album first thing tomorrow!\n\nFucking awesome melodic punk rock. You better check this shit out.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n01.
