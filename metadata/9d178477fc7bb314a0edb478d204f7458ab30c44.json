Most of the real collectors have never seen an original copy! By the way the band was banned from radio stations in Australia an New Zealand because the albums front cover was judged pornographic. Their music are really great-compact rock songs and if you need a band to compare with take KILLING FLOOR. Musically it\\'s driving heavy progressive rock typical of New Zealand and Australia (like Human Instinct but a bit harder) In places the band have a Hendrix vibe whilst at other times UK early \\'70\\'s bands such as Human Beast come to mind.\n\nBand:\n\nMichael Bishop (guitar, vocals)\nBob Bowman (guitar, vocals)\nErrol Bradshaw (drums, vocals)\nJohn Jeavons (bass, vocals)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Witches Wand (2:45)\n02.YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Surprised (2:41)\n03.ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Amazing (3:21)\n04.Happy Children (3:07)\n05.Everything (3:16)\n06.Maybe Tomorrow (4:19)\n07.Reminiscing (2:52)\n08.Change Your Mind (2:57)\n09.Corrupt One (3:47)\n10.Lost (3:06)\n11.My Life Is Filled With Changes (3:05)\n12.Portrait of Disgust (4:53) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d178477fc7bb314a0edb478d204f7458ab30c44","amp;dn":"Luv+Machine+-+Luv+Machine+%281971%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d178477fc7bb314a0edb478d204f7458ab30c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,23,132,119,252,123,179,20,160,237,180,120,210,4,247,69,138,179,12,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
