He now lives in Shoreham-By-Sea and has been performing regularly with Spencer Davis Group as well as recently guesting on a Jon Lord solo album, &quot;Pictured Within&quot;.\nMore or less a vehicle for Anderson's songwriting output (he wrote all of the album's material), Hemlock sounds by no means artificial or put-together. Rather, they were a typical British blues act, without the requisite posing. Naturally, the atmosphere is very serious and dominated by Mick Weaver's passionate organ-playing.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
