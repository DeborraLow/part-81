The guide will provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the design issues involved in delivering sustainable buildings, and giving detailed description of the process of integrating principles into practice. One hundred buildings, ranging from small dwellings to large commercial buildings, and drawn from a range of countries, demonstrate best current practice. The sections of the book are divided into design issues relating to sustainable development, including site and ecology, community and culture, health, materials, energy, and water. With over 400 illustrations, this highly visual guide will be an invaluable reference to all those concerned with architecture and sustainability issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5473eb9876fa81945f72586b16ace55133aaf4","amp;dn":"Strategies+for+Sustainable+Architecture+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5473eb9876fa81945f72586b16ace55133aaf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,84,115,235,152,118,250,129,148,95,114,88,107,22,172,229,81,51,170,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
