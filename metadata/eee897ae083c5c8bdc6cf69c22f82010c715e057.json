Last week, during an appearance on the Alex Jones Show, Madsen revealed that the White House has targeted him for elimination. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey want to kill you,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a government source told the journalist. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was perfectly clear that the phrase was not being used as a figure of speech,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ writes Madsen. On April 13, Madsen told Jones unequivocally that he does not intend to commit suicide. Madsen said in order to protect himself, he has decided to leave the country.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
