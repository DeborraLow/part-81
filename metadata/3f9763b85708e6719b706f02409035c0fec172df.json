Alex also talks about the effort by people around Gov. Rick Perry to absurdly characterize him as an Obama operative for criticizing him for his inaction on TSA sexual molestation. \n\nAlex also talks [hour 3] with regular Friday guest, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster. Chapman runs down the latest on the slowly disintegrating economy and other sundry topics. \n\nThough not billed on the web site, Max Keiser is a guest in the second part of hour 2, through the fist five minutes of hour 3.\n\nToday's broadcast went 5 minutes into a 4th hour. \n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
