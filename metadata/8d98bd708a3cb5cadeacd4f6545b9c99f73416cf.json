It also comes with a competitive two-player Puzzle\n\nBattle to pit wits.\n\n\n\nFor the younger player (and maybe the more mature) there are also\n\nrichly detailed Jigsaws to complete. This features alongside a set of\n\npuzzle-form mini-games.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the experience is  Explorer mode  in which up to four\n\nplayers compete to claim territories on the planet. Unlike Risk\n\nhowever, this global domination is achieved by correctly answering\n\nquestions as well as competing in the puzzle based mini-games.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Unpack\n\n2. Mount\n\n3.
