But his new CD Folk-Worn Prose shows that the form still has endless possibilities. Rather than letting the scaled-back instrumentation be a limitation, Cromwell invokes a variety of influences from old-timey country to ragtime to more contemporary. He's a great writer. His compositions are outwardly simple in sound but hold a good deal of musical and lyrical sophistication. He's got a very appealing musical persona, and he's a tasteful guitarist, joined by a variable small group of like-minded players.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/03/shaun-cromwell/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c0ef8053065753f53bbea5163365af057c6823f","amp;dn":"Shaun+Cromwell...Folk-Worn+Prose%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c0ef8053065753f53bbea5163365af057c6823f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,14,248,5,48,101,117,63,83,187,234,81,99,54,90,240,87,198,130,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
