It's fortified and hard to attack, so a creative, cynical        \n    major gets the assignment to figure something else. With the help of     \n    Paco, a Filipino guerrilla leader, the major devises a plan to put       \n    four women assassins among the prostitutes. He must recruit and train    \n    them, convince his general that an unarmed woman can best a man, and     \n    get them on the island. The rest is up to them. An imprisoned killer,    \n    a nurse with a fatal disease, a chippie on the lamb from the mob, and    \n    a Filipina whom the Japanese assaulted are his team.
