Using social entrepreneurship as an umbrella-term for a variety of social processes reflected in the text Minna Shkul offers a theoretically informed social-scientific reading of Ephesians. This reading demonstrates the extensive socio-ideological shaping within the letter, as well as the writer's negotiation of different group processes throughout it. Shkul also examines the emerging Christian identity in the text, testing its ideological and social contours and its reforms upon Jewish traditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db12174673e2e98d3e1475480d237fca3c005e86","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Reading+Ephesians+Exploring+Social+Entrepreneurship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db12174673e2e98d3e1475480d237fca3c005e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,18,23,70,115,226,233,141,62,20,117,72,13,35,127,202,60,0,94,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
