Previously enrolled at a private school, where he picked up some snobbish tendencies, Will now attends a comprehensive school and has had to make a new set of friends, Simon (Joe Thomas), Lee (James Buckley) and Neil (Blake Harrison), none of whom are that cool or credible.\n\nThe Inbetweeners offers a comedic take on growing up in middle-class suburbia. A place where there are no teen pregnancies, no drugs, no knife fights and no guns. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about a bunch of lads who get into real scrapes rather than real trouble.\n\nReview - The Inbetweeners is a breath of fresh air to comedy programs, not over the top stupidity, nor do you have to be at all intellectual to find it funny, the plot revolves around 4 young students entering sixth form and follows there days as your average teenager, its the great mix of characters which makes this worth your time in watching as i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m sure most people can relate to one of the 4, based in the UK the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;average\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; group of friends find them selves in all sorts of awkward, embarrassing and often hilarious moments which all of us would have probably encountered sometime or another in our teen years,I hope to see more of these new actors in the future, this series is just what we needed, a comedy of the new generation. \n\n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz \n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY! \n\nIf you would like to live chat or instant message me, here is one of my many contacts -  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1978777e7c75707a7d7c7476772f205971766d74787075377a76376c72&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
