Four glowing pods sparkle and crackle while hiding behind the meteor shower. A mysterious force (that was left unidentified) makes the meteor shower turn a hard right towards a bright blue ball in the distance - planet Earth. In a comfortable suburban house in Michigan, Stuart Pearson (Kevin Nealon) and his wife Nina (Gillian Vigman) head a family that includes adorable seven-year-old Hannah (Ashley Boettcher); 15-year-old Tom (Carter Jenkins), a techno-geek whose grades have gone south; and older sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), who's just returned from a secret outing with boyfriend Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman). Deciding the family needs some good old-fashioned togetherness, Stuart packs up the clan and heads to a three-story holiday house in the middle of nowhere. Joining them is Uncle Nate (Andy Richter), Nate's son Jake (Austin Butler), Nana Rose (Doris Roberts), and identical 11-year-old twins Art (Henri Young) and Lee (Regan Young). An unexpected arrival is Bethany's beau Ricky, who wrangles an overnight visit with the extended family. As day turns to night, dark storm clouds start swirling around the house. Suddenly, four glowing objects shoot toward the roof. The alien crew inside the objects is made up of Skip, the tough commander, Tazer, a muscle-bound dude armed to the teeth, Razor, a lethal female alien soldier; and Sparks, a four-armed techie, who is the only non-threatening alien intruder.\n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy | Family\n\nRelease date: 12 August 2009 (UK)\n\n\ncast\n\n# Carter Jenkins as Tom Pearson\n# Ashley Tisdale as Bethany Pearson\n# Robert Hoffman as Ricky Dillman\n# Austin Butler as Jake Pearson\n# Kevin Nealon as Stuart Pearson\n# Doris Roberts as Nana Pearson\n# Gillian Vigman as Nina Pearson\n# Henri Young as Art Pearson\n# Regan Young as Lee Pearson\n# Tim Meadows as Doug Armstrong\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Aliens in the Attic 2009 720p BRrip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1683.51 MiB\nDuration: 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 743 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72876550968135820028.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72876550968135820028.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63521959032528454849.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63521959032528454849.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/82461743830456911864.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/82461743830456911864.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/11018307714105899606.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/11018307714105899606.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83408291512504676515.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83408291512504676515.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68809537317198886015.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68809537317198886015.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6039973127ef20ebc075db7b866948d37274e9de","amp;dn":"Aliens+in+the+Attic+2009+720p+BRrip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Relea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6039973127ef20ebc075db7b866948d37274e9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,57,151,49,39,239,32,235,192,117,219,123,134,105,72,211,114,116,233,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
