AnyReader is a perfect example of such software.\n\nEffectively copies corrupt data from any type of disks or erroneous connections if standard copying methods fail. AnyReader supports resumed downloads from the remote PC if the connection was broken during the copy process (especially useful for unreliable Wi-Fi networks).\n\nAnyReader is great for copying files from scratched CD/DVD/Blu-ray(BD) or defective floppy/hard disks. Normally when your computer is unable to copy files from a damaged disk it will abort and delete the part of the file it has copied. AnyReader will continue copying the file right to the end; any data that hasn't been recovered after several retries is replaced with blanks. This will allow you to effectively read every byte of information that can be read at all.\n\nNote: Using AnyReader is safe and risk-free. The software does not write data to your original disks, but saves the recovered data to a new folder that you specify.\n\n Here are some situations where AnyReader can help:\nYour CD/DVD/Blu-ray(BD) drive can't read bad, scratched or trashed disks; \nThe standard copying method fails because of an error, such as &quot;(Bad CRC) A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum error occurred&quot;, &quot;Cannot read from the source file or disk&quot;, an unknown error or a bad disk; \nYou have 2 bad copies of a file that you would like to put right; \nYou can't download a file across wireless LAN because of a bad connection; \nAnd many more of those...  \n\n===============================================================================\n\n1. Unrar &amp; scan the .exe file with your Antivirus pro (for safety)\n\n2. Run (as Administrator for windows vista &amp; 7)the file &quot;AnyReader v 3.8 by\n   Moon-Dancer.exe&quot; &amp; install the software\n\n3. run the program and click register offline input serial &quot;included in my\n   torrent&quot; and click register\n\n4. Done \n\n6. When Thomas Edison worked late into the night on the electric light, he had\n   to do it by gas lamp or candle. I'm sure it made the work seem that much\n   more urgent.\n  \n   Hope ends when you stop believing, Life ends when you stop sharing\n\n7.
