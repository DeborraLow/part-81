It affects dialogue but there\n\tis a subtitle for what was being whispered so no info is\n\tmissed. There is a very slim chance this will reair and \n\tsince it's such a minor glitch we chose to release this one. \n\t\n\tThe episodes recorded from the VH1 marathon of this season\n\twere all edited so &quot;previously on&quot;, &quot;next week on&quot; and the\n\topening titles were all cut out. That's what making runtime\n\tshorter than usual. \n\t\t\n\tINFO:\n\t\n\tMINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n\tthe gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7108051973761ac0439cebcfb306974a1f85b62d","amp;dn":"The.Real.World.Road.Rules.Challenge.S19E05.720p.HDTV.x264-MiNDTH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7108051973761ac0439cebcfb306974a1f85b62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,8,5,25,115,118,26,192,67,156,235,207,179,6,151,74,31,133,182,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
