ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t listen to metal, in fact I am often searching\nfor new metal bands, but there in lies the problem. As a listener of music, I do like to listen to bands\nthat are different to the norm, and at the moment metal music seems to be in a rut (with only a few\nexceptions).\n\nBlatherskite is one of these exceptions, they are very close in sound to Tool, but with less math-rock\nelements and more grooves.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Where the Wasteland EndsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fourth studio album and has been\nlauded by many, for good reason.\n\n&quot;Where The Wasteland Ends&quot; - Blatherskite\n\nBlatherskite are a five piece made up of two guitars, bass, drums and vocals. The two musicians that\nstandout are Nick Goryl (Vocals) and Brendan Davie (Drums), I always say that a band has to have\nsomething that puts them above other bands, in this case itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the bands chemistry and musical ability.\nJust listening to the recording, you can tell that this band is tight, Davie seems to keep pace on drums\nand this really rubs of onto the rest of the band. I also canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fail to mention the singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hauntingly\nsimilar voice to Maynard James Keenan, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite impressive. His voice is one of the highlights of the\nband and it really stands out on the album, especially on the opening track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MajesticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nThe production is impressive and especially on an album that has had minimal backing in term of funds.\nA lot of smaller bands fall over with the production and in my experience it does have a very large\ndetrimental effect if the production is not up to standard, but in the case of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere The Wasteland EndsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nthis is not an issue.\n\nThere is only one disappointing aspect of the album though, in the end there is a lack of a standout song\nthat really imprints itself into your memory and I think most top-class albums have a song that achieves\nthat. Because of this, the album a piece of music that has to be listened to in full.\n\nAs an album itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bordering on a top-class album, but it lacks that little bit that would make it into a\ngreat album. In saying that though, I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remember an Australian metal album that betters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere The\nWasteland EndsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Sure, KarnivoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThemataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and CogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe New NormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are amazing albums, but they both\nstray from metal and delve into prog-rock, causing me to usually lump them into the rock genre, unlike the\ntwo bands mentioned, Blatherskite sounds like a metal band.\n\nOverall, why would you listen to this band? Well, the answer to that is simple. They are a band that has\nincredible chemistry and have made an album that stands up to most metal albums made in the last decade.\nThe fact that they are a part of the Australian music scene, should evoke pride because I think one of the\nnegatives of the Australian music scene is the lack of quality metal bands.\n\nSupport this band, they should be a well known Australian act, but for one reason or another they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t.\nGet onto them.\n\n\nReviewers Pick: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajesticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nStand-out Tracks: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajesticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDogsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nRating: 7.9&quot;\n\n\n*************\n\n\nI also highly recommend the bands Rishloo and Prisma if you like Blatherskite.\n\nEnjoy &amp; please seed!\n\n\n*************\n\nYours truly\n\nFLAC the Ripper\n\nDon\\'t mind me giving the trade name\n\n*************&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;accac0cdcfd8c4c9dec5dcdcc9deeccbc1d482cfc3c1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;*************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:110443227d332c768d3241aacdc3e7d688cba075","amp;dn":"Blatherskite+-+Where+The+Wasteland+Ends+%282010%29+MP3+%40+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"110443227d332c768d3241aacdc3e7d688cba075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,4,67,34,125,51,44,118,141,50,65,170,205,195,231,214,136,203,160,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
