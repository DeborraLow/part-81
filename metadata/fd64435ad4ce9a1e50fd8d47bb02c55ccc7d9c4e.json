Recorded over a span of about two years at the Red Room Studio in their home town of Staten Island, NY.\n\nCombining Folk, Rock, Indie and a mix of other genres, the album sometimes sways towards an acoustic singer songwriter style and at others goes straight rock and roll! It is filled with coming of age tales like &quot;Captain Hook&quot;, and blue collar anthems such as &quot;Garbage Man&quot; which has been featured on NYC Rock Station 101.9 WRXP\n\n\nWhat people have been saying:\n&quot;the title track itself is a prime example of this bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to seamlessly adhere musical convergence with a continual flow of familiarity. Bringing you into their world expecting one thing and then twisting it just enough to satisfy you in ways similar bands wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bother to try, yet never overcooking any of their original formula.&quot; - Vincent Forte, DockStreet.com\n\n&quot;(Drummer) Picciotto and bassist Mike McDonnell pull the rhythm section from subtle accompaniment to full-throttle bombast, and Joe PecoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s effected, rough-edged guitars put the whole thing over the top.&quot; - Ben Johnson, Staten Island Advance\n\n&quot;...a couple of songs into it, and I'm like 'o my god, this is the band'. Like of all the stuff that started in Staten Island.... This is my favorite band out of Staten Island... &quot; - Rich Russo, WRXP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd64435ad4ce9a1e50fd8d47bb02c55ccc7d9c4e","amp;dn":"Slip+Away","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd64435ad4ce9a1e50fd8d47bb02c55ccc7d9c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,100,67,90,212,206,154,30,80,253,141,71,187,2,197,92,204,125,156,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
