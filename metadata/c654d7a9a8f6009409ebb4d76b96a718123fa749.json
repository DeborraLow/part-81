However, Mo has an idea of how to deal with the reporters and grinds up some tablets into a dozen mugs of tea. She then hands out the cups to the press outside, but Alfie demands to know what she's up to, fearing that she's poisoned them. One of the reporters then comes into The Vic wanting to use the toilet, and Mo tells Alfie that she slipped laxatives into all of the cups. Soon afterwards, everyone gets a surprise when Charlie arrives at The Vic with a cuddly toy. Kat is thrilled to see him and the pair have a tearful reunion.\n\nOver at the cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, a local reporter approaches Whitney and manipulates her into talking to him, telling her that he's from the Walford Gazette and wants to set the record straight because he doesn't like the way Ronnie is being portrayed by the national press.
