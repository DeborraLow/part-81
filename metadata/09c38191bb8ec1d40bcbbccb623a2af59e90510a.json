Bought them myself from their page, so they're as original as can be.\nOne member of the band plays/used to play in ISIS. This band plays instrumental post-rock, meaning no vocals at all. Just purely the outstanding, progressive, building-up sound of post-rock, nothing more, nothing less. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c38191bb8ec1d40bcbbccb623a2af59e90510a","amp;dn":"Red+Sparowes+%5BDiscography%5D+%5B320kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c38191bb8ec1d40bcbbccb623a2af59e90510a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,195,129,145,187,142,193,212,11,203,188,203,98,58,42,245,158,144,81,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
