In 1588, as England defended her shores against the Spanish Armada, the San Salvador was captured off Portland and gleefully looted by the locals.\n\nWeymouthÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s popularity as a seaside resort was enhanced dramatically from 1789 onwards, when King George III frequently visited to bathe in the gentle waters of the bay. You will also re-live the history of OsmingtonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s famous White Horse, the Roman Villa at Preston and the airfield that once stood on the nature reserve at Lodmoor.\n\nWeymouth suffered greatly in World War II, as devastating air raids destroyed much of the Chapelhay district, yet the town went on to play a key role in the path to final victory. In 1944 many thousands of American troops embarked from the harbour for the D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches.
