Although Bregna is idyllic, people are disappearing and everyone is having bad dreams. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â on Flux is a member of the 'Monicans', an underground rebel organization who communicate telepathically and are led by The Handler. After a mission to destroy a surveillance station, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â on comes home to find her sister Una has been killed for supposedly being mistaken for a Monican. When ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, Trevor Goodchild, she discovers that she is unwittingly playing a part in a secret coup.This discovery causes ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â on to question the origin and destiny of everyone in Bregna; and in particular, her own personal connection to Trevor. It turns out that every person in Bregna is actually a clone, created with recycled DNA. With the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives, there has been an increase in the populace's troubling dreams. Recycling and cloning has became necessary since the original virus antidote made humans infertile. Trevor's experiments, and of all his clone ancestors, have been trying to reverse the infertility. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife, Katherine and is the first Katherine clone in over 400 years.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease date: 17 February 2006 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nCharlize Theron\nSophie Okonedo\nMarton Csokas\nJonny Lee Miller\nFrances McDormand\nAmelia Warner\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Aeon Flux 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:1976.97 MiB\nDuration:1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate:2 977 Kbps\nSubtitles:Arabic,English,Swedish,Vietnamese\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-06-18 21:18:40\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/47659940463247521276.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/47659940463247521276.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00963885581363611809.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00963885581363611809.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57154620440147259524.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57154620440147259524.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96403073587913665852.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96403073587913665852.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15560766814953815502.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15560766814953815502.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12731935931244515069.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12731935931244515069.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5781ca754d64890095828662eb31416f9747b90","amp;dn":"Aeon+Flux+720p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5781ca754d64890095828662eb31416f9747b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,120,28,167,84,214,72,144,9,88,40,102,46,179,20,22,249,116,123,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
