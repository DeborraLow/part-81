This duo continued to collaborate until issue #111, when Mark Bagley left the book and was replaced by Stuart Immonen. Bendis and Bagley's run on Ultimate Spider-Man set the record for longest continual run on a Marvel Comics series by two people, an honor previously held by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on Fantastic Four. After issue #133, the series was relaunched as Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, still written by Brian Michael Bendis with art provided by David Lafuente.\n\nMost files sourced from the Complete Marvel Chronology Project, courtesy of PeteThePIPster.
