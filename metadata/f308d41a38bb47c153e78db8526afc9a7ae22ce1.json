As the Minotaur writhes on the ground, badly wounded but still      \nnot ready to succumb to deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s waiting embrace, you sprint over and        \ntake hold of its piercing horns. With muscle-tearing effort, you            \ngrapple with the monster, twisting its neck as it desperately tries          \nto break free of your hold. A horrific snap echoes across the room:          \nYou have won the fight. His limp body falls pitifully to the ground,        \nforgotten as you run off to your next conquest. God of War III              \nrelishes death like few other games, glorifying the downfall of              \nmythical beasts, rock-solid Titans, and not-quite-immortal gods in          \ngrotesque and satisfying fashion. The visceral combat and overwhelming      \nsense of scale that have become the hallmarks of this brutal franchise      \nhave been pushed further than ever before in God of War III, creating        \nan experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down,    \nand even harder to forget.                                                  \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \nNotes:                                                                      \n                                                                           \nFor use with a jailbroken PS3 and backup manager.
