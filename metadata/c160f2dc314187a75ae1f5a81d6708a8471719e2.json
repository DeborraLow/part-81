After their Chicago meeting the idea for a collaborative project between the two bands was formed. Soon the opportunity arose to record in a band setting and the five that would become OHMphrey want to PolandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s downtown L.A. studio to rekindle the experience they created months earlier at the Chicago gig. The band recorded over the course of two days resulting in a unique and improv-heavy album.\n\nComplementing and rooting the stratospheric musical moments heard on this record is the rubbery and often tricky rhythmic approach of the Myers-Pagliari/drum-bass tandem. The combination of Myers' complex time grooves and Pagliari's fretless acrobatics (a la Brand X's Percy Jones) lays a powerful foundation that allows immense freedom for the soloists. Poland's virtuosic playing evokes Holdsworth and Beck while Cinninger pulls from a huge array of textures pulled from Pink Floyd to Metallica to Prince. Cummins tastefully adds in both background coloring and a few impressive solo spots of his own.\n\nThe band released their self-titled debut &quot;OHMphrey&quot; on May 19, 2009 with Magna Carta Records.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c160f2dc314187a75ae1f5a81d6708a8471719e2","amp;dn":"OHMphrey+-+OHMphrey+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c160f2dc314187a75ae1f5a81d6708a8471719e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,96,242,220,49,65,135,167,90,225,245,168,29,103,8,168,71,23,25,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
