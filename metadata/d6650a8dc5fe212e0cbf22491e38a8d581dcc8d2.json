Whereas Jim Carrey's Truman had no idea his life provided fodder for a TV show, the upper-crust enclave that welcomes the Joneses has no idea they're a marketing unit in disguise. One day, Steve (David Duchovny, more Californication than The X-Files) and Kate (Demi Moore, whose businesslike demeanor serves the premise well)arrive with teenagers Jenn (Amber Heard) and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) and a moving van full of luxury goods. Attractive and charismatic, they inspire everyone they meet to purchase the same sportswear, golf clubs, and gourmet foods (Lauren Hutton plays their supervisor). They make the biggest impression on Larry (Gary Cole) and Summer (Glenne Headly), whose marriage has hit a rough patch. Steve advises his new golf partner to buy his wife expensive presents. Larry takes his advice--and then some--in an attempt to keep up with the Joneses, who find it difficult to maintain the Stepford-like faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade when Jenn gets involved with a married man and Steve falls for his make-believe wife. \n\nSize: 697.19 MB\nVideo\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate : 903 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.500\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.182\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 101 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nBurn Tested and ready to go!\nMany thanks to all uploaders, peer groups and everyone who shares to keep doing what we do!!!\nMany thanks to the original uploaders for sharing this movie!!!!\nTo care is to share, so please seed for AS LONG AS YOU CAN, thanks!!!\n\n~~~Pandora~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6650a8dc5fe212e0cbf22491e38a8d581dcc8d2","amp;dn":"The+Joneses+%282009%29+DvdRip-Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6650a8dc5fe212e0cbf22491e38a8d581dcc8d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,101,10,141,197,254,33,46,12,191,34,73,30,56,168,213,129,220,200,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
