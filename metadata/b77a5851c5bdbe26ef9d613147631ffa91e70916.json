We see this story through a bizzare myriad of characters and situations, which include the eccentric Uncle Sanny, the &quot;Fat Boy Called Bitch&quot;; (John's little brother, Poochie), his mom, his evil grandmothers, and Lee Stratsberg, not to mention a brief appearance by Spike Lee as God Almighty.\n\n\n==================================\n\nThis came from a triple pack which includes John Leguizamo's &quot;Sexaholix&quot;, &quot;Mambo Mouth&quot;, and a bravo-profile documentary *(mislabled on the dvd as spic-o-rama and yet to be uploaded)\n\nHere are the links for sexaholix and mambo mouth:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5816330/Sexaholix-DVDrip-klownkillah&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5816330/Sexaholix-DVDrip-klownkillah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5816329/Mambo_Mouth-DVDrip-klownkillah&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5816329/Mambo_Mouth-DVDrip-klownkillah&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77a5851c5bdbe26ef9d613147631ffa91e70916","amp;dn":"John_Leguizamo-Freak-%28DVDrip%29-klownkillah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77a5851c5bdbe26ef9d613147631ffa91e70916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,122,88,81,197,189,190,38,239,157,97,49,71,99,31,250,145,231,9,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
