This audio is all ripped from live concerts on Youtube, so the quality is iffy at best. However, I don't think any of it is too terrible. I hope you enjoy it.\n\n&quot;Kuolema Tekee Taitejilian&quot; isn't from a Nightwish concert, but from a performance by Anette with a Swedish orchestra.\n\nTracks included:\nShe Is My Sin\nKuolema Tekee Taitejilian\nDark Chest Of Wonders\nEver Dream\nSleeping Sun\nWishmaster\nWhile Your Lips Are Still Red\nWish I Had An Angel\nCadence Of Her Last Breath (not an older song, but didn't appear on the official live album)\nDead To The World\nHigher Than Hope\nGhost Love Score (my favorite of the bunch)\nSlaying The Dreamer\nDead Boy's Poem\nCome Cover Me\n\nSee my other torrents for a couple complete bootleg Nightwish concerts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7561d562f4f90c8515d6306a26a67c91a59d531","amp;dn":"Nightwish-Live+With+Anette+Olzon+%28bootleg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7561d562f4f90c8515d6306a26a67c91a59d531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,86,29,86,47,79,144,200,81,93,99,6,162,106,103,201,26,89,213,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
