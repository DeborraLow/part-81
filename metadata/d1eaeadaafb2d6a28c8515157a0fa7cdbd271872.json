Her change in record label and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanies a notable shift from the Christian gospel rock of her self-titled debut album. The album was released in the United States and Canada on June 17, 2008 and has sold over 7 million copies worldwide up to June 2010. The album features the Billboard Hot 100 number one single &quot;I Kissed a Girl,&quot; top 3 single &quot;Hot n Cold,&quot; top 10 single &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot;, and top 30 single &quot;Thinking of You&quot;. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album has earned Perry two Grammy nominations.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 47, based on 18 reviews.\n\nThe album received positive reviews from Billboard magazine who claimed, &quot;not since Jagged Little Pill has a debut album been so packed with potential hits.&quot; Blender described the album as &quot;PerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creative-writing-class punch lines donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always justify her self-congratulatory drag-queen tone. But she hiccups quirkily enough, and myriad big-name producers (from Dr. Luke to Glen Ballard) keep the new-wave synth hooks hopping.&quot;\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), better known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American singer-songwriter and musician. Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California, and raised by Christian pastor parents; she grew up listening to only gospel music and sang in church as a child. After earning a GED during her freshman year of high school, she began to pursue a music career. She released a self-titled gospel album in 2001 as Katy Hudson which failed with the closing of its record label that year. She recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed most of a solo album from 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005, neither of which were released.\n\nAfter signing on with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single, &quot;Ur So Gay&quot;, that November, which garnered attention but did not chart. She rose to fame with her second single &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; in 2008, which topped international charts. Perry's first mainstream album, One of the Boys, followed later that year and was eventually announced to be the thirty-third best selling album of 2008 worldwide. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America; &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; and her second single &quot;Hot N Cold&quot; both received multi-platinum certifications. Perry was ranked the 97th Artist of the 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“10 decade by Billboard. She became known for wearing unconventional style of dress, often combining colors and vintage fashion. Her next album, Teenage Dream, is scheduled to be released in August 2010.\n\nPerry had a long relationship with Travis McCoy; she is currently engaged to Russell Brand.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1eaeadaafb2d6a28c8515157a0fa7cdbd271872","amp;dn":"Katy+Perry+-+Lost+%28Live-MTV+Unplugged%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1eaeadaafb2d6a28c8515157a0fa7cdbd271872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,234,234,218,175,178,214,162,140,133,21,21,122,15,167,205,189,39,24,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
