ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cautionary greeting also applicable to artists of other idioms and eras, as Sub RosaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Going Where the Water Drinks Like Wine makes abundantly clear. As part of the labelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ongoing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFundamentalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series, the focus is on rare or lost recordings. The reality remains that most musicians who aim for lasting fame end up missing the mark by a wide margin.\n\nThe 18 Southern Pre-War bluesmen represented across the collectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 24 tracks never made it bigger than regional recognition; a majority didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even make it that far. Any aspirations and efforts toward such ends were curtailed by the vagaries of the early recording industry and record-buying public, often as much as by the times in which they lived. Nearly all experienced lifestyles that included some combination of itinerant travel, chronic unemployment, substance abuse, incarceration and generally recurring disappointment. In other words, exactly the sort of stuff that the blues are made of.\n\nSome of the musicians are justifiably obscure, but each of the cherry-picked selections has something worth recommending. Luke JordanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pair of pieces lay out the racial politics of their time, with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTraveling CoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ relating the Zelig-like adventures of the titular trickster folk hero and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPick Poor Robin CleanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ marking first-person use of the pejoratives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œniggerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcoon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ RamblinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Thomas waxes on the twin scourges of a broken relationship and insolvency on the succinctly-titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo Job Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while Noah LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ closing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDevil in the WoodpileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ constitutes a medicine show precursor to the sort of call-and-response harmonica workouts players like Sonny Boy Williamson and Sonny Terry would later perfect. An early influence on Son House, Rube Lacey wrings raw emotion out of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMississippi Jailhouse GroanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHam Hound Crave,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ his keening wordless punctuations sailing across metronomic guitar riffs. Those six short minutes constitute his sole recorded legacy.\n\nAll of the tracks are riddled with at least some degree of surface noise ranging from mild (in the case of Tom DicksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLabor BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to the damagingly invasive (Willie BakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Luck MoanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Sylvester WeaverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simply titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGuitar BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ offers carefully constructed bottleneck variations, laced with the hiss and crackle from eroded shellac. Buddy Boy Hawkins is buried under buzzing, chipped-groove striations, his guitar picking barely audible. Ishman Bracey, a contemporary of the influential Tommy Johnson, fares better, his ringing picking comparatively clean against his starkly articulated tale of love gone bad. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tempting to wish that these compromised sounds arose out of continuous play and enjoyment on the part of their previous owners, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just as likely the outcome of prolonged poor storage and exposure to inclement elements.\n\nIn years past, this sort of rarified material was largely the province of exhaustive specialty labels like the London-based Document and the stateside curators at Yazoo. Sub RosaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reach and distribution encompasses a different demographic and hopefully this means these largely forgotten sounds will make it into the hands of a whole new set of potential fans. Either way, the sounds will continue to survive in digital form, their makers remaining ripe for posthumous re-discovery.
