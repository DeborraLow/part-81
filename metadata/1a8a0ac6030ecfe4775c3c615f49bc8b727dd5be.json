It was an amazing success, and an album followed. To those who don't know Piaf or find her a bit dated (which is a comment I've received at times) I would strongly recommend Jo's renditions as an introduction. To those who know of and appreciate Piaf I would say: try this on for size, I was moved!\n\nFiles are 320 KBPS MP3s ripped with EAC from the original album, tags added with MP3Tag. Sorry, no playlists, I don't use them, nor do I care for them. Here's hoping someone will enjoy this as much as I did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8a0ac6030ecfe4775c3c615f49bc8b727dd5be","amp;dn":"Jo+Lemaire+-+%5C%22Une+Vie+-+Edith+Piaf%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8a0ac6030ecfe4775c3c615f49bc8b727dd5be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,138,10,198,3,14,207,228,119,92,60,97,95,73,188,139,114,125,213,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
