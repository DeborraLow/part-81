Well, then you are in a wrong company most\nlikely. This is not the place for you if the only thing you care about\nis your own skin. You won't get what you are looking for. Just forget\nabout it.\n\nOther people download and if they do not see crowds of people downloading,\nthey don't seed either thinking &quot;well, there is no one interested it seems&quot;.\nAre you sure?\n\nPeople may come tomorrow and they may not come in huge crowds.\nYou have been taken care of one way or the other. Do you care about\nanybody else?\n\nBasically, all Osho torrents should have at least 50 seeders each,\nand that is from a specific data samples. But what we have instead\nis about 1 person out of 50 seeding. Do you think &quot;your problems&quot; are over\nonce you download it but do not care to seed? Think again...\n\nThe bottom line: if you don't seed then you &quot;don't care&quot;,\nand if you don't care, do not waste your life on Osho to begin with.\nJust get lost, and that is about the best thing you can do to yourself.\nIf your sensitivity only extends to your skin level, then it is phony.\nIt is just the same ugly ego trip, accumulating, accumulating and\naccumulating, hoping to get to &quot;heaven&quot; one day. Sorry, no such pleasures\nwill be provided in this case.\n\nOtherwise, enjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f13d9ac714d1f113318a24852a037b5fb7d50c","amp;dn":"Osho+-+Philosophia+Perennis+Vol.+2+-+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f13d9ac714d1f113318a24852a037b5fb7d50c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,241,61,154,199,20,209,241,19,49,138,36,133,42,3,123,95,183,213,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
