Just beware of the marauding lions and barbarian hordes.\n\nDespite what the name implies this has relatively little to do with Civilization, beyond a similar interface and a number of wonders of the world to build. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not necessarily a criticism though as your start practising your city planning skills, creating homes and work for your citizens and guard towers to make sure theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re protected. Interestingly the primary focus of the game is on increasing the quality of your housing and therefore the social status of your citizens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which in turn brings in more taxes. There are some annoying bugs, and the concept is hardly a new one, but if you prefer your video games a little slower paced then this offers plenty of entertainment.\n\nThere are a number of missions where you have to build your city against the clock, either to combat natural disasters such as brush fires or to make sure youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ready when an enemy army comes knocking at the town gates.\n\nThe developers of CivCity: Rome are British studio Firefly who were responsible for the Stronghold series of castle building simulators. The CivCity name is expected to become a whole new series of games.\n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;CivCity Rome.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93563e4b76ebeda3b8579fde412629d38f1e11a1","amp;dn":"CivCity.Rome.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93563e4b76ebeda3b8579fde412629d38f1e11a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,86,62,75,118,235,237,163,184,87,159,222,65,38,41,211,143,30,17,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
