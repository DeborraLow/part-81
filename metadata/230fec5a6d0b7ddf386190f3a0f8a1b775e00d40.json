This means that no matter where you are, there will be someone there to talk to you.\n\n* Diverse Community - Unlike most servers that have a 95% United States population, we are truly diverse. We have had registrations from over 70 countries. Click on Active Players on the left column, and you will see that the people currently playing come from all over the world.\n\n* Reliability - Most private WoW servers are run by kids in their spare time, and the servers vanish when the kid gets bored or runs out of money. ITRWoW has been around since mid-2007. In all that time, we have had exactly 1 rollback of 24 hours. There have only been a few instances where we were down for more than 1 hour. There have been no &quot;wipes&quot; and no one has ever lost a character or account. Our members donate enough money to pay our expenses, so you know we'll be here tomorrow. All player data is backed up off-site, so even if our server dies, your character will still be there.\n\n* Powerful machine - The WoW server software is run on a powerful server machine that is housed at a business-class data center. This means it has direct access to multiple internet backbones within the United States, and will never suffer slowdowns common to residential DSL and cable connections.\n\n* Best server software - Unlike other private servers whose software is years out of date, we get our patches directly from the developers as they're made available. This means fast bug fixes for you.\n\n* No speedhacks, flyhacks, etc. - Other private servers tend to be vulnerable to cheating tools, which means you'll always see noobs flying around without a mount, or zooming across the world at 1000x speed. Those cheating tools do not work on ITRWoW, so you know people will be playing fair (more or less).\n\n* Jam-Packed Auction House - Both alliance and horde have access to an Auction House that is jam-packed with thousands of useful items at reasonable prices. Most private servers make it near-impossible to aquire good items, short of picking them up from monsters. We give you many options.\n\n* Sub-Bank - The sub-bank is an account-wide bank that all of your characters have access to. Use its enormous 300-item capacity to store your excess inventory, or transfer items between characters. \n\nDonation-Only Features\n\n\nWe have many unique features available specifically for our players who donate.\n\n\n* Flying Mounts in Azeroth - Never before seen in World of Warcraft, the flying mounts come to Azeroth. Fly over the the lands you used to walk over.\n\n* Soulbound Transfer - Use the sub-bank to transfer soulbound items between your characters.\n\n* Bonus Talent Points - A few additional talent points for your characters, so you can get those extra skills you've always needed. \n\n* And much more donation features.\nOnline/Offline Statistics: \nServer is tested every 10 minutes for availability\nPercent Online: 100%\nPercent Offline: 0%","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230fec5a6d0b7ddf386190f3a0f8a1b775e00d40","amp;dn":"ITR+WoW+3.3.5+-+Play+for+free+on+private+server","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230fec5a6d0b7ddf386190f3a0f8a1b775e00d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,15,236,90,109,11,125,223,56,97,144,243,160,248,161,183,117,224,13,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
