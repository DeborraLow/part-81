(^_^)\n\nI love this show, I cant wait for the second season to air, which is scheduled for November 2010.\n\nThis show has one of the guys from The Tudors in it.\n\nShow Nfo - A group of kids doing community service get struck by lightning during a storm, and begin to develop superpowers. \n\nReview - Never have I laughed so much at a bunch of snotty, revolting weirdos who should be deserted on a remote island for the sake of the rest of us. Have just finished watching episode 6 and am dying for another series to be made. Episode 2 made me snort my tea through my nose with laughter/horror/revulsion, it was epic.\n\nI don\\'t get the comparisons with Heroes - other than the \\'superpowers\\', this bears no resemblance to the \\'save-the-world\\' schtick and good-v-evil piety Heroes is full of. This is definitely black (with a collection of mottled stains that it\\'s best not to ask about). I\\'m still undecided about Simon (sweet underneath or fundamental embryonic psychopath); I\\'d have to throttle Nathan if he were my offspring, but he\\'s a joy to watch, I look forward to the series\\' \\'ressurrection\\'...... \n\n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY!\n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
