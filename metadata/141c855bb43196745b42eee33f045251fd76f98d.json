Comprised of 11 tracks, Eclipse is a bold and powerful album encapsulating perfectly everything that makes Emalkay such a prodigious talent, effortlessly showcasing the depth and diversity of his sound while always remaining true to his inimitable style. As addictive as it is hard hitting, the album doesnt just provide a collection of dancefloor tracks, but a confident and coherent artistic statement.\n\nTracklisting\n\n01 Fabrication\n02 Crusader\n03 Keep Goin' On (feat Baby D)\n04 Space Hopper\n05 Transpose\n06 Flesh &amp; Bone (feat Rod Azlan)\n07 The World (feat Lena Cullen)\n08 Metropolis\n09 Why DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t I Like You (skit)\n10 When I Look At You\n11 True Romance \n12 Weapons of Mass (Bonus)\n13 Eclipse Album Mixtape","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:141c855bb43196745b42eee33f045251fd76f98d","amp;dn":"Emalkay+-+Eclipse+%28320+KBPS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"141c855bb43196745b42eee33f045251fd76f98d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,28,133,91,180,49,150,116,91,66,238,227,63,4,82,81,253,118,249,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
