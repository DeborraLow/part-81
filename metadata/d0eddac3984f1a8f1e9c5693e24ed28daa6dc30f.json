In a relative short concert Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express performed 7 great songs. The video isn't the greatest quality and at parts it's a bit dark. The sound is almost decent. There is a constant hiss in the audio but it's very listenable. The audio is Mono and the video has a few small cuts in between songs. The show is entertaining enough and Meat Loaf's voice sounds terrific. All in all this is a DVD to enjoy.\n\nPAL DVD\nRunning time: 70 minutes\nSound: Mono\nChapters: Yes for each song\nCover: Created and included\n\nSet List:\n01 Out of the Frying Pan\n02 Masculine\n03 You Took the Words\n04 All Revved Up\n05 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n06 Bat Out of hell\n07 Rock and Roll Medley\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0eddac3984f1a8f1e9c5693e24ed28daa6dc30f","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Flushing+Meadows+1988+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0eddac3984f1a8f1e9c5693e24ed28daa6dc30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,237,218,195,152,79,26,143,30,156,86,147,226,78,210,141,170,109,195,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
