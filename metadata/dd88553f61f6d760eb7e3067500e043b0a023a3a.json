Despite the human military force's and Master Chief's efforts, the Covenant have breeched the Earth's defenses and have left its inhabitants in a dismal situation. In the midst of desperation, players assume the role of Master Chief and lead the resistance against the Covenant to save the people of Earth from a gruesome demise. Halo 2 features an immense and epic single player mode, as the story picks up where it ended in the first game. In addition to the single player mode, Halo 2 also features a redesigned multiplayer mode. While the first game limited players to LAN connectivity, Halo 2 takes multiplayer missions online by way of Xbox Live. \n\n\n\n\nCredits: JaMbo87\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd88553f61f6d760eb7e3067500e043b0a023a3a","amp;dn":"Halo+2+XBOX+NTSC.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd88553f61f6d760eb7e3067500e043b0a023a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,136,85,63,97,246,215,96,235,126,48,103,80,14,4,59,10,2,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
