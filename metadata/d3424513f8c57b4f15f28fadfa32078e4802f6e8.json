Best evidence has them forming sometime in the late 1960s in Poughkeepsie, New York, by guitarists Larry LaFalce and Dino Paolillo. The duo was soon joined by Geno Charles (Drums), Frankie Previte (Vocals), Ron Piccolo (Keyboards) and Lenny Venditti (bass). LaFalce and Venditti were formerly with NY bands The Pyramid, Previte had been with The Oxford Watchband, and Piccolo a member of The Revells. With Vinny Testa producing, the group released a self-titled debut in 1971 on Mercury Records but poor marketing and sales meant that the band only issued one more album, 1972ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFree For AllÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, before Bull Angus split up (although Previte will forever be a footnote in pop history for penning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Time of My LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the Dirty Dancing soundtrack!).\n\nIt is odd that Bull Angus didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make a larger impact at the time; their brand of post-psychedelic heavy blues successfully crossed between jam-happy Southern Rock and budding Progressive Rock. The material was often compared to heavyweights like Uriah Heep, Atomic Rooster, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple as well as homegrown Grand Funk Railroad, but the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dexterity and large roster meant they could occasionally leave hardrock behind and dabble in early Crimson-style folk. Despite all this, Bull Angus never earned a cult following and has remained underappreciated to this day.\n\n\n\n==================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bull_angus/free_for_all/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bull_angus/free_for_all/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nashratom\n3.50 stars\nLast album by obscure US band, whose 2 albums on Mercury graced the $1 bins for years, but now are quite collectible. Similar to the first album - an appealing mix of hard rock, bar boogie, late psych and proto prog. Organ and guitar are the focal instruments. I also pick up a distinct &quot;Midwest Progressive Rock&quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ sound on a couple of tracks, which prompted me to do a little research. Turns out, they're actually from upstate New York, but did do extensive touring in the Midwest region. They opened for major acts like Fleetwood Mac and Deep Purple, so they may have had some impact amongst the crowd. A good friend of mine will tell you Bull Angus were the best US band ever, and he's heard a ton of music, so they definitely had something going on here.\n\n\n\nHellBentForLager\n4.00 stars\nOften overlooked early '70s hard rockers Bull Angus' second and last album Free For All is less heavy than their superior self-titled debut, more jammy and progressive-minded (especially on the first side), but is still a solid offering from the upstate New York six-piece. Once again produced by Vinny Testa, the 1972 release opens strong with the lengthy &quot;Lone Stranger&quot;, but never really kicks into high gear again until side two's awesome opener &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;, a spirited run through a personal favorite Beatles' deep cut from The Beatles [White Album], which is followed by the equally cool &quot;Drivin' Me Wild&quot;, pompy &quot;(We're the) Children of Our Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Train Woman Lee&quot;.\n\nI'm not sure how the group's singer Frankie Previte spent the rest of the '70s following the band's breakup, but he resurfaced in 1980 fronting the slick AOR group Franke &amp; the Knockouts, who released three albums and had a couple hits (Top 10 &quot;Sweetheart&quot;) before splitting as well. Amazingly enough, Previte then went on to score a Hollywood hat trick by winning an Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe for composing that annoying theme song to the 1987 film Dirty Dancing. Funny how things turn out.\n\n\n\nbnoring\n3.50 stars\nSecond album from these underrated early 70's hard rockers, and although not as good as their debut - still pretty good listen. Similar to a bands like Grand Funk and Bloodrock.\n\n===================================================================\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBull Angus - Free For All\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bull Angus\nAlbum................: Free For All\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: Exact Audio Copy (Secure mode) &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 80 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: FLAC 8\n\nRipped by............: cozzmick on 4/18/2011\nPosted by............: cozzmick on 5/10/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front Back CD\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
