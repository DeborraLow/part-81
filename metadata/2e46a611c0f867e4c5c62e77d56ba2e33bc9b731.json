The show informs on skepticism and critical thinking, and features discussions of myths, conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, the paranormal, and many general forms of woo-woo, from the point of view of scientific skepticism. The show also features discussions of recent scientific developments in layman's terms, and interviews authors, people in the area of science and other famous skeptics as well as paranormalists.\n\nThese are the first 100 episodes of the show, originally aired between 2005 and 2007. All episodes are available for free download on the website, www.theskepticsguide.org, but this torrent allows for easier download. The podcast is still being produced weekly, and has just recently hit 300 episodes.\n\nIf I have missed any episodes, please comment and let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e46a611c0f867e4c5c62e77d56ba2e33bc9b731","amp;dn":"The+Skeptics%5C%27+Guide+to+the+Universe+-+first+100+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e46a611c0f867e4c5c62e77d56ba2e33bc9b731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,70,166,17,192,248,103,228,197,198,46,119,213,107,162,227,59,201,183,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
