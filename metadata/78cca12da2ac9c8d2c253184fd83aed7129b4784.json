The source file was cropped, filmed at a angle, really dark, colours whacked etc ...\nYet again weve tried to fix the problems we could ... we didnt mess with the angles etc ... not worth it on such a low quality cam. However with fixed the\ncolours and also made it brighter.\nGot to be honest and even after fixing it the film is still dark and dull looking ... increasing the colours much more gave it this weird affect and making it \nbrighter only made it look more grey and didnt seem to do much.\n\nAnyway enjoy, until we get a new source :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295571.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295571.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-297049.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-297049.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295694.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295694.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295890.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/scott/vlcsnap-295890.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDONT THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78cca12da2ac9c8d2c253184fd83aed7129b4784","amp;dn":"Scott+Pilgrim+vs+The+World+TS+READNFO+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78cca12da2ac9c8d2c253184fd83aed7129b4784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,204,161,45,162,172,156,141,44,37,49,132,253,131,174,215,18,155,71,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
