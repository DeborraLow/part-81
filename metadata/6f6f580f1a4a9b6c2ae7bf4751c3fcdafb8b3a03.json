After moving to a new school, he meets Agatsuma Soubi, who claims to have known his brother. Ritsuka eventually discovers that Soubi and Seimei used to be a fighting pair, whereby Soubi was the &quot;Fighter&quot; and Seimei was the &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. Now that Seimei is gone, Ritsuka has inherited Soubi, who will become his &quot;Fighter&quot;. After learning that Seimei was killed by an organisation known as the &quot;Seven Moons&quot;, Ritsuka decides to investigate into his brother's death, with the sometimes useless help of Soubi, along the way.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nEpisodes have no OP or ED, all 20 minutes long\n\nRipped, Subbed, Re-encoded by BloodAche.com\n\n704x464\n\nJapanese Audio, English Subtitles\n\nBest Source of This Anime Available \n\nEach episode 60mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6f580f1a4a9b6c2ae7bf4751c3fcdafb8b3a03","amp;dn":"Loveless+Series+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6f580f1a4a9b6c2ae7bf4751c3fcdafb8b3a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,111,88,15,26,74,155,108,42,231,191,71,81,195,252,218,251,139,58,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
