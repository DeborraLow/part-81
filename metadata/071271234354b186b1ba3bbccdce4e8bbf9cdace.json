With the start up of his label\n        Rotterdam Records back in 1992 and unleashing his first release \n        under the Euromasters guise, Paul Elstak subconsciously created \n        the future for a whole new music genre, soon to be known as \n        hardcore. By steering the Rotterdam Records label in the direction \n        of worldly fame, Paul Elstak rapidly became the personification \n        of hardcore, copied by many but hardly equaled.\n\n        As the inventor of the genre, Paul Elstak brought hardcore music \n        to the masses by developing a new event phenomenon and named it \n        A Nightmare in Rotterdam, nowadays known as Nightmare. With \n        infamous editions in the Energiehal in Rotterdam, Paul Elstak \n        created a tremendous group of hardcore fanatics and loyal visitors \n        of all Nightmare events to come. As the patron of hardcore and the\n        creator of the Nightmare events, it was evident that Paul Elstak \n        would create his own Nightmare on a double CD sooner or later.\n\n        Nightmare - Create The Future is Paul Elstak's personal blueprint \n        of how a Nightmare event should be portrayed. Similar to the \n        Nightmare event on the 4th of December 2010 in Ahoy' Rotterdam, \n        this Nightmare compilation is divided in two &quot;areas&quot;: present \n        hardcore and early rave. CD1 showcases the very best of the current \n        scene, selecting furious tracks from the Paul Elstak lab such as The\n        Evolution Of Hate, I'm Not An Addict and God's Will (under his \n        The Hitmen alias) and from icons such as Dione, DJ Partyraiser, \n        Tommyknocker, Tieum, Dano and many more. This first disc even \n        contains no less than three official Nightmare 2010 anthems!\n\n        The second disc offers the very best of the past and considering \n        Paul Elstak's rank in hardcore history, who better than the man \n        who rocked the hardcore cradle to pick 'n choose the early rave \n        gems? An eighteen track travel through hardcore times offering \n        tracks from DJ Isaac, DJ J.D.A., Shadowlands Terrorists, Frankfurt \n        Terror Corps and Bodylotion amongst others, accompanied by Paul \n        Elstak classics marking the absolute hardcore milestones of \n        far-from-forgotten times.\n\n        Sorry for all the fans, but no Turbo on it!\n\n        Enjoy!\n\n\n        _________________________[ Tracklist ]____________________________\n\n\n       CD 1/2\n\n        1.
