These brilliant\n\nshows have not been released in any form until now, the 40th anniversary of the 1970 show.\nLive At The Forum features earth-shaking live performances of the group's best-known hits - &quot;I Want You Back,&quot; &quot;ABC,&quot; &quot;The Love You\n\nSave,&quot; &quot;I'll Be There,&quot; &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; and more. Single B-sides &quot;I Found That Girl&quot; and &quot;I'm So Happy&quot; and such surprises\n\nas album cuts &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;Zip A Dee Do Dah,&quot; plus songs not released by the J5, including covers of James\n\nBrown's &quot;There Was a Time&quot; and the Isley Brothers' &quot;It's Your Thing,&quot; are part of the shows. The 1972 show also features a full,\n\nfantastic set of Michael's solo hits, including &quot;Got To Be There&quot; and &quot;Ben,&quot; his brand new single at the time, as well as a solo\n\nspot by Jermaine.\n\nDisc 1 includes the Forum show recorded June 20, 1970, when the group broke existing box office records at the venue. The J5 were on\n\ntheir first national tour, and the show is a unique document of the growing &quot;Jacksonmania&quot; gripping the globe. Disc 2 is the\n\ncomplete show from August 26, 1972, just three days before Michael's 14th birthday. Each disc includes a bonus track: an unreleased\n\nfull live version of &quot;Mama's Pearl,&quot; from the concert that became part of the 1971 TV special Goin' Back To Indiana, closes Disc 1;\n\n&quot;I Wanna Be Where You Are,&quot; from the soundtrack album to Save The Children, makes its CD debut at the end of Disc 2.\n\nLive At The Forum is housed in a collector's digi-pak with rare photos, collectable postcards of each Jackson brother and insightful\n\nliner notes by Mark Anthony Neal.\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/57d3/4dc5ae89.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
