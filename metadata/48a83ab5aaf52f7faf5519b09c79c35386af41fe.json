At this point The GSF is playing a frantic collage of speed metal, hardcore punk, surf, jazz, noise and really anything they damn well please!  Their influences vary pretty widely from Iron Maiden to Buddy Guy to the Bad Brains to Earth Wind &amp; FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ etc.  Their main goal being: to stick to their ideals of artistic integrity, originality, and chaotic fun while hammering out a diehard following, and having a blast along the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48a83ab5aaf52f7faf5519b09c79c35386af41fe","amp;dn":"Gnome+Sorcery+Federation+discography+plus+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48a83ab5aaf52f7faf5519b09c79c35386af41fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,168,58,181,170,245,47,127,175,85,25,176,156,121,195,83,134,175,65,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
