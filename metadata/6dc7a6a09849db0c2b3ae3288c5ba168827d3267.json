Asserting that pirates came in all shapes, sexes, and sizes, this engaging study ultimately portrays pirates not just as mere thieves and killers but as radical activists with their own society and moral code fighting against an empire. \n\n===========\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLife Under the Jolly Roger will appeal to anyone interested in pirates\nand radical practice. It brings the golden age of piracy to life and shows\nus the link to contemporary radical politics. I recommend this book to\nthose who identify with pirates and seek a well-reasoned analysis of their\nlegacy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Luis A. Fernandez, author of Policing Dissent\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPiracy is as relevant in todayÃƒÅ Ã‚Â¼s world as it ever was, and if you want to\nunderstand why it happens and what it really means, this is the book to\nstart with. While modern-day robber barons give pirating a bad name,\nthis important book restores the balance through a lively and provocative\nnarrative. Definitely one to read, and to treasure!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Randall Amster,\nprofessor of Peace Studies at Prescott College, Arizona","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc7a6a09849db0c2b3ae3288c5ba168827d3267","amp;dn":"Life+Under+The+Jolly+Roger+-+PDF+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc7a6a09849db0c2b3ae3288c5ba168827d3267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,199,166,160,152,73,219,12,43,58,227,40,140,91,161,104,130,125,50,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
