In contrast, Ip Man and Ip Man 2 focus on the events in his life that took place during the Second Sino-Japanese War and after he moved to Hong Kong. As a child, Ip Man learns Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun together with Ip Tin-chi (Ip Man's adopted brother) and Lee Mei-wai. After Chan's death from illness, Ip continues to learn Wing Chun from his senior, Ng Chung-sok, before eventually leaving Foshanto study in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, during a hockey match, Ip and his schoolmates are racially insulted by a Westerner. Ip Man defeated him and his popularity soared after the incident. While getting medicine to treat the Westerner, he meets master Leung Bik, who is actually the son of Leung Jan, Chan Wah-shun's teacher. Ip Man learns a different, improved style of Wing Chun from Leung and his prowess in martial arts improves tremendously. Meanwhile in Foshan, Ip Tin-chi rose to become a prominent businessman under another Wing Chun martial arts association.\n\n\naudio : DD5.1\n\n1. Cantonese\n2.
