A subsequent clarification reveals that his real name is Sean Rafferty, and he admits to killing, not seven, but eleven men. Things only get worse after Sean gets in the bad books of the local militia, and with armed bounty hunters hot on his trail, challenges the local unarmed blacksmith, Jack Smith, to a duel - wild west style! \n\nvideo: 964 kbps\n\n640x272\n\n1h 29m: audio: MP3 @ 128 Kbps: subtitle: English\n\n\n\n[img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/175/E4FA621861A51E09B44842B10595E2EB.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc8bce705483ce17c75682950749e29e4e149d1","amp;dn":"Gunless.2010.STV.DVDRip.XviD-Kata","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc8bce705483ce17c75682950749e29e4e149d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,200,188,231,5,72,60,225,124,117,104,41,80,116,158,41,228,225,73,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
