That same night, the past and present intertwine; before the siblings' helpless eyes, a family is persecuted, tortured, and murdered step-by-step in the manner described in the diary. The siblings' trip becomes a nightmare, in which they don't know if the people whom they're trying to save are real... or manifestations of something that occurred twenty years ago. Following the trail of 'the disappeared', they discover that, beyond the fiction, the true horror is hidden in the reality: 30 000 people were kidnapped, tortured, and murdered under Argentina's military dictatorship. The people forget, but the pain, as a physical presence, lives on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e463838fa77705974943ff1f890a0c5804e60c61","amp;dn":"The+Appeared+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e463838fa77705974943ff1f890a0c5804e60c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,99,131,143,167,119,5,151,73,67,255,31,137,10,12,88,4,230,12,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
