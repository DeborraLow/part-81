David Hartman returned to this show in \nthe regular role of Shiloh ranch hand David Sutton during\nthe following 1968-1969 season.\n\nEventually he gave up acting after his &quot;Lucas Tanner&quot;\nseries was cancelled in 1975.  Then he finally found\nsuccess on TV being himself -- a co-host on \n&quot;Good Morning America&quot; for many years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8756cd60b105788a55d4477d66fd5450fceeb00","amp;dn":"THE+VIRGINIAN+--+The+Masquerade+%28+6th+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8756cd60b105788a55d4477d66fd5450fceeb00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,117,108,214,11,16,87,136,165,93,68,119,214,111,213,69,15,206,235,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
