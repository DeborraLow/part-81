Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each one .... one folder at a time.\n\nI found a small &quot;feature' that I had to fix - that's why this V2.2 is already published.\nWhen copying or moving files, the application would just overwrite any existing file with the same name. Now all files will be renamed as either decimal or hexadecimal. Should you have files within the folder with the same renamed names, it will still overwrite them, so make sure to move those files.\nE.g. 00000010.jpg or 0000000A.jpg\n\nRequirements: .NET 3.5 and additional V2.0 .NET framework\n\n\n- (C) 2011 114 Dasma Software, Philippines\nApplications Games SEO &lt;a href=&quot; http://114-software.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://114-software.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d6725044be5e3e6f402b27512d2279b3d4eb0d","amp;dn":"Batch+Move+Copy+Images+V2.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d6725044be5e3e6f402b27512d2279b3d4eb0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,214,114,80,68,190,94,62,111,64,43,39,81,45,34,121,179,212,235,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
