It's created by adding the packages of the KDE-Solaris project on top of a regular OpenSolaris image. Apart from setting KDE as default, there are no other customizations. \n\nMonday, August 16, 2010\nKDE 4.5.0 &amp; Korona for OpenSolaris\nThe latest and greatest stable release of KDE4 is again available as IPS binary packages at the usual place (and the usual mirror in case you hit problems downloading).\nSince 4.4.5, many improvements were done in terms of packaging correctness (dependencies, linking), thanks to hnhn's adaptation of alanc's check-deps script.\nAlso Qt was updated to 4.6.3, Amarok to 2.3.1, Koffice to 2.2.1, as well as few other KDE dependencies.\nLast but not least, kdel10n-* packages are present, providing support for 55 languages.\nThe upstream changes are best described in the KDE 4.5.0 announcement.\nThe showcase of the kde-solaris project, Korona 4.5.0, combining the powers of the late OpenSolaris b134 and KDE 4.5.0 has just been uploaded and should become available in a few hours at http://genunix.org. As a small improvement, the nepomuk stuff is disabled there and akonadi appetite has been minimized. I had to do this otherwise desktop metadata would fill the $HOME, which lead to crashes. (Note that konversation was unintentionally ommited from the live cd, sorry.)\n\nRead more : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.hajma.cz/2010/08/kde-450-korona-for-opensolaris.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.hajma.cz/2010/08/kde-450-korona-for-opensolaris.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDE_on_Solaris/OpenSolaris/Korona&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDE_on_Solaris/OpenSolaris/Korona&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 00e6e1aabf7350e583e7b0f19e26abbf  Korona4.5.0.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4907a8ec2d402a1b01447c4811063db8eb238c2a","amp;dn":"Korona4.5.0.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4907a8ec2d402a1b01447c4811063db8eb238c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,7,168,236,45,64,42,27,1,68,124,72,17,6,61,184,235,35,140,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
