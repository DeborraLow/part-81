Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies.\n\n\nAfter playing in rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will HuntingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1998.\n\nSmith suffered from depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was posthumously released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n\n\n2000\n\nElliott Smith Live at Empty Bottle 2000-02-26.flac.zip 585,58MB\nElliott Smith Live at Embryo Festival (Electric SBD) 2000-07-04.shn.zip 519,00MB\nElliott Smith Live at North Star Bar 2000-02-21.flac.zip 322,66MB\nElliott Smith Live at Roseland Theatre 2000-11-10.flac.zip 699,67MB\nElliott Smith Live at The Forum 2000-10-05.flac.zip 646,38MB\nElliott Smith Live at The Roxy 2000-02-17_flac.zip 370,09MB\nElliott Smith Live at The Tabernacle 2000-10-21.flac.zip 596,23MB\nElliott Smith Live at Variety Playhouse 2000-05-08.flac.zip 684,79MB\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info: \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPart 3 will be uploaded after this one is uploaded and fully seeded!!\nSo, it is up to you seeders &amp; leechers to decide if more will follow indeed...\n\n\n\n\n\nAND AS ALWAYS: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\n\n\n\n\nI KNOW IT'S A BIG ONE, BUT IT'S ALSO THE ONLY TORRENT PRESENTING ALL THE LIVE SHOWS!!!\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS ARE WELCOME.
