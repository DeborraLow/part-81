She does not reciprocate his love but after some wooing falls for him. At this time Trisha is called back to India by her father as he wants to perform her marriage with Venu Madhav, son of his sister Telangana Shakunthala. Chandu is all along led to believe that he is an orphan. But it is not so. He is the son of Sathyaraj and his father sends his son away to Australia as he does not want him to get involved in faction politics. Chandu's mother and brother were killed by Kota and his brother Supreet. \n\nWhen Chandu arrives in Kadapa and goes to meet Mahalakshmi, her father Kota sees a brilliant opportunity to settle scores with Sathyaraj. He sends Chandu to kill Sathyaraj saying that he is trying to scuttle his marriage with Mahalakshmi. Chandu does not know that his father is alive and that it is actually his father whom he is going to take on now. Will Chandu kill his own father or will he die in the hands of his father?
