The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings in Hastings, England at the age of 15 in the blossoming scene of acid house to the apex of the international dj'ing world, he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both djs and producers globally. In fact, he has reached the very top of his profession, being voted 1 in a voter's poll by DJ magazine in 2001. John Digweed has become the peoples choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture. \n\n\nMarkus Schulz is a man on a mission. He dreams of meeting the world. This dream just might be possible. Markus has been traveling the world this past year playing his personal brand of dark, moody, melodic trance and meeting as many people as possible.\n\nTransa will need no introduction to the majority of readers, currently sitting at number 30 in the world dj poll, producer and remixer to the stars and a member of numerous acts. A mixture of hard work, determination and raw talent has catapulted Transa to the status as one of the most definitive and influential artists in the dance music scene today, although to pigeonhole Transa to one genre of music would be a crime in itself\n\nDash Berlin is the future. Dash Berlin is a true deejay at heart with a profound passion for the comprehensive culture of dance music.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:668ddc4258f4d849ee1f77c772d183396157086d","amp;dn":"Best+DJ+Sets+from+Miami+WMC+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"668ddc4258f4d849ee1f77c772d183396157086d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,141,220,66,88,244,216,73,238,31,119,199,114,209,131,57,97,87,8,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
