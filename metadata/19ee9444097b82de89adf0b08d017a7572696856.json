Palermo\\'s (of Electro group Femme Fatality) solo project. The songs share the stories of his tour adventures, love sagas, and tales of ballroom brawls from a tell-it-like-it-is approach. While all the ditties were originally showcased as solo/acoustic, they are now rarely performed the same way twice at a live performance.\n\nCentral Standard Time is the first full length Album available from The Sudden Passion. Although the songs on the record were written at various times between 2005-2010. The Songs were recorded in 2009-2010 in St. Louis, MO (where Palermo is originally from) and Silver Lake, CA (where the band now resides).\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nFor Fans of:\nBright Eyes, Clem Snide, David Allan Coe, Johnny Cash, Elliot Smith, Femme Fatality, Wilco, Sun Volt, Fleet Foxes ,Beck, Andrew Bird, Antlers, Devendra Banhart, Bishop Allen, Blind Pilot, Blitzen Trapper, Bowerbirds, Bright Eyes, Cat Power, DeVotchKa, The Dodos, Fanfarlo, Feist, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, Great Lake Swimmers, Guster, Iron &amp; Wine, Kings of Convenience, Laura Marling, Mount Eerie, Mumford &amp; Sons, Neutral Milk Hotel, Noah and the Whale, Conor Oberst, Okkervil River, Sufjan Stevens, The Tallest Man on Earth, The Avett Brothers and M.
