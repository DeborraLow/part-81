Charlie support a squabbling, stoned, but nonetheless spectacular Fleetwood Mac on their Rumours tour but the album meets with mediocre response in the UK now in the grip of punk.\nThe band consider calling it a day. Unbeknown to the band, the album had been released in the US on the Janus label. The song Johnny Hold Back was getting massive radio play, the album is zipping up the Billboard charts, and suddenly everybody is a lifelong friend. The band go to the US as opening act for a Doobie Brothers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“shedsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tour on the back of Minute By Minute. This heady experience was marred only by Steve Gadd getting his hand broken by a security guard (!) in Lousiville, KY. Doobies drum tech and Charlie admirer Shep Lonsdale steps in to save the day. After 6 weeks it was back to the UK to write and record Lines, at Trident Studios, in the Autumn of '76.\n\nThis recording is from the last night of their first American tour in support of the Doobie Brothers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOfficial website: http://charlie-music.com/\n\ntorrent source: http://thepiratebay.se/user/cheborneck/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbcb52b2b9051282ed87822ec8201fbcd41230b6","amp;dn":"Charlie+-+Dayton+OH+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbcb52b2b9051282ed87822ec8201fbcd41230b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,203,82,178,185,5,18,130,237,135,130,46,200,32,31,188,212,18,48,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
