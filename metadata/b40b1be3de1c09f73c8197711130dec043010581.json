And\nyet a handful of these tracks - &quot;Save Your Time,&quot; &quot;Island\nof Life,&quot; the title cut - pass muster by Blackfoot's future\nhigh standards, and in retrospect, there's no telling what\nproper promotional support could have done for Flyin' High\n(after all, Blackfoot on a bad day still beat hell out of\nthe competition). But the album was roundly ignored by\nconsumers, saw the group dropped for the second year\nstraight, and would join its predecessor in cutout bins,\nlanguishing out of print for decades on end. By the time\nBlackfoot made a comeback with 1979's watershed Strikes LP,\nmany new fans simply assumed that this was actually the\ngroup's first release, rather than a case of well-deserved\nthird time lucky.\n\n1.
