Rhodes documents how the implementation of a totalitarian infrastructure in the United States has led to the President having supreme power to assassinate US citizens by declaring them \\&quot;enemy combatants\\&quot; and how this sets an ominous benchmark for the level of power that has been accumulated by the executive branch of government. The federal government, the Southern Policy Law Center and the ADL have all targeted Oath Keepers simply because the group attempts to re-affirm commitment to the bill of rights amongst active duty soldiers and law enforcement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9311655ad1f4268262f136ecfa7eba81b4550bea","amp;dn":"States+Strike+Back+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9311655ad1f4268262f136ecfa7eba81b4550bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,17,101,90,209,244,38,130,98,241,54,236,250,126,186,129,180,85,11,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
