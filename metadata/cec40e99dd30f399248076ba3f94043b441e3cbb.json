However, some are quite offensive, mostly to religions, Republican party (of the USA) and its voters or generally somewhat rude. I suggest selecting the good ones for wieving and sharing and deleting the rest.\n   You will need to unzip the nine files. Pictures are grouped regardless of their content with the aim of providing several batches of mixed content, funny and meaningfull cartoons. I intend to sort them thematically and upload as another torrent in the future.\n\njakuzem\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec40e99dd30f399248076ba3f94043b441e3cbb","amp;dn":"andy_singer_cartoons_collection_noexit_and+_other_unsorted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec40e99dd30f399248076ba3f94043b441e3cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,196,14,153,221,48,243,153,36,128,118,186,63,148,4,59,68,30,60,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
