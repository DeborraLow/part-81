It is 12 years since a British driver won the European Grand Prix, a statistic that both Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button will be desperate to end as they chase world championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The McLaren duo both claimed podium places in Valencia last year, but it was Vettel who took the victory, finishing five seconds clear of Hamilton. Home hopes will be pinned on Ferrari star Fernando Alonso, who won this race in 2007, when it was held at Germany's Nurburgring.\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057b77f466a1bab32185d6a6550e28b2f43e2aa0","amp;dn":"Formula+1+2011+-+R08+European+Grand+Prix+-+Race+.thebox.Golficus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057b77f466a1bab32185d6a6550e28b2f43e2aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,123,119,244,102,161,186,179,33,133,214,166,85,14,40,178,244,62,42,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
