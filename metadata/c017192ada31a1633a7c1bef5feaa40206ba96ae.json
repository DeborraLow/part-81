It was released in 1999 on Stretchy Records. Like previous studio albums by the band, Waterfall Cities was recorded at guitarist Edward Wynne's home studio, The Mill, and features a cover by the artist Blim.\n\nThe Ozric's music is a highly psychedelic mixture of thumping basslines, sound effects and keyboard and guitar work, with a sound influenced by Steve Hillage and Gong. Many of the Ozrics' songs are in unusual time signatures and/or unusual Eastern-influenced modes. Furthermore, the band often features complex arrangements which change time signature, key signature and tempo frequently in the course of a track, a well-known element present in Progressive rock. In places, this is deliberately confusing; however, there are also moments of straightforward funk-influenced grooves and a strong influence from jazz fusion.\n\nThese features are mixed with electronic elements, including densely layered psytrance- and techno-influenced arpeggiated synthesizers, pads, synth basslines, effects and programmed drumbeats. It also has a strong influence from dub and ambient music, with many quiet relaxed tracks that balance the frenetic, intense material.\n\nThe Ozrics also use a wide range of instruments in their performances. Electric and acoustic guitars, flutes, recorders, xylophones and even sounds of digitally tweaked human voices appear throughout.\n\n\n   1. &quot;Coily&quot; (Ozric Tentacles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:19\n   2. &quot;Xingu&quot; (Wynne, Seaweed, Geelani) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:27\n   3. &quot;Waterfall City&quot; (Wynne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:03\n   4. &quot;Ch'ai?&quot; (Wynne, Seaweed, Geelani) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n   5. &quot;Spiralmind&quot; (Wynne, Ozric Tentacles, Geelani) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:41\n   6. &quot;Sultana Detrii&quot; (Ozric Tentacles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:18\n   7. &quot;Aura Borealis&quot; (Wynne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:40\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c017192ada31a1633a7c1bef5feaa40206ba96ae","amp;dn":"Ozric+Tentacles+-+Waterfall+Cities+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c017192ada31a1633a7c1bef5feaa40206ba96ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,23,25,42,218,49,161,99,58,124,27,239,95,234,164,2,6,186,150,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
