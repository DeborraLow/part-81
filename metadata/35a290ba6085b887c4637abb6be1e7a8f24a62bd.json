Graham was a 'profiler'; one who profiles criminal's behavior and tries to put his mind into the minds of criminals to examine their thoughts while visiting crime scenes. Will is called out of his self-imposed retirement at the request of his former boss Jack Crawford to help the FBI catch an elusive serial killer, known to the press as the 'Tooth Fairy', who randomly kills whole families in their houses during nights of the full moon and leaves bite marks on his victims. To try to search for clues to get into the mind of the killer, Will has occasional meetings with Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, a charismatic but very dangerous imprisoned serial killer that Will captured years earlier which nearly drove him insane from the horrific encounter that nearly cost Will's life\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/87740888716953349263.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/87740888716953349263.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/96349673207122966312.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/96349673207122966312.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/13156421720149453789.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/13156421720149453789.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/78403071873157377588.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/78403071873157377588.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 650 MiB\nDuration : 2h 0mn\nOverall bit rate : 757 Kbps\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 2h 0mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 625 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 2 679 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 2h 0mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 151 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a290ba6085b887c4637abb6be1e7a8f24a62bd","amp;dn":"Manhunter+%5B1986%5D+BRRip+x264+%5BZeberzee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a290ba6085b887c4637abb6be1e7a8f24a62bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,162,144,186,96,133,184,135,196,99,122,187,107,225,231,168,242,74,98,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
