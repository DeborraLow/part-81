What follows is an extraordinary song cycle of rare and timeless power that bears a rather fitting title. As people today may or may not remember, the word &quot;foundling&quot; is defined as &quot;an infant found after its unknown parents have abandoned it.&quot; And as Gray puts it with a warm laugh, &quot;Foundling sort of arrived at my door without my asking it to, so it felt very appropriate for this album.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab24315da3b05c9c8ddb183ec8cf528848f8fe57","amp;dn":"David+Gray+-+Foundling+%5B2cd-mp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab24315da3b05c9c8ddb183ec8cf528848f8fe57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,36,49,93,163,176,92,156,141,219,24,62,200,207,82,136,72,248,254,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
