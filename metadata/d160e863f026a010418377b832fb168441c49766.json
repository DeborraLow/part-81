Spanish film, directed by Nacho Cerda in 1993, no subs - but no dialogues. :)\n\n2) Short German gore about Hitler's experiments with zombie. Directed by JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rg Buttgereit, creator of Schramm, Der Todesking and (in)famous Nekromantik series!\n\n3), 4), 5) - Three amateur (almost) no-budget Finnish short gore movies, imagine something like mix of Frankenstein, Re-animator and lots of sensless violence ;). Two of them have engilsh subs in .srt file.\n\n6), 7) - Two amateur German gore movies. Hardcoded english subs.\n\n8) Movie is in polish and I do not think there are english subs anywhere, but anyway You can try it. \n\nDudes responsible for this movie wanted to create a trilogy, but there is only one (first) part relased so far. \n\nHere You have their official site - http://obrobka-skrawaniem.prv.pl/ You can &quot;googletranslate&quot; it, but results may be wicked.\n\nShort, amateur black comedy with some gore. Inspired by Lynch, &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Evil Dead&quot;.\n\nMovie in .rmvb file\n\nTitle? Title means this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining in polish :D\n\n9) Amateur and a bit crappy prequel to Evil Dead saga. Sam Raimi's debut movie from 1978, so do not expect wonderful effects. Polish subs in separate file.\n\n10)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28film%29 ( &lt;- Spolier warning here!) Highly recommended, weird and wicked experimental movie.\n\n\nI have completed this collection from various internet sources. Download, enjoy and spread this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d160e863f026a010418377b832fb168441c49766","amp;dn":"10+gore+movies%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d160e863f026a010418377b832fb168441c49766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,96,232,99,240,38,160,16,65,131,119,184,50,251,22,132,65,196,151,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
