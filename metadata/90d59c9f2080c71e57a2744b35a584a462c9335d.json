And why shouldn't he? She is beautiful and popular. Rich but incredibly sweet with a rare innocence. In other words: Way out of Victor's league. Unfortunately Anya also dates a rich guy, Peter, who drives a fancy lotus and has a stuffed Gucci wallet. However chance meetings riddled with awkward hiccups soon makes sparks fly between Anya and Victor. Maybe Victor's shy and goofy charm can beat out Peters arrogance?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d59c9f2080c71e57a2744b35a584a462c9335d","amp;dn":"Love.At.First.Hiccup.2009.DVDRiP.XViD-RCDiVX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d59c9f2080c71e57a2744b35a584a462c9335d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,213,156,159,32,128,199,30,87,162,116,75,53,165,132,164,98,201,51,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
