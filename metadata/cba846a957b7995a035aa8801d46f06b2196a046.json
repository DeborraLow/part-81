She was originally an independent artist and had released an independent album, Just a Breath, in 2004. Her first studio album on Fervent Records, My Paper Heart, was released on July 22, 2008. Her first single, &quot;I'm Letting Go&quot;, was released to radio stations in spring of 2008 and has charted on national Christian CHR charts since then. The song was the 16th most played song of 2008 on Christian radio stations according to R&amp;R magazine. Francesca Battistelli has received her first Grammy Award 2009 nomination for &quot;Best Gospel Performance&quot; with her single Free To Be Me.\n\nBattistelli's music has been given several different genre labels. A reviewer once said that &quot;Battistelli's soulful piano-pop sound resembles a blend of her music interestsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½jazz, rock, gospel and R&amp;B.&quot; Battistelli stated that when she first began writing music, &quot;I really longed to bring something authentic to the [Christian music] scene that even non-Christians could listen to.&quot;\n\nFrancesca's track &quot;Blue Sky&quot; featured on the Hollister Playlist for December 2009.\n\nBattistelli was born on May 18, 1985 in New York City. She grew up in a musical family with both of her parents involved in musical theatre. &quot;There was just something about live theaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially musical theaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that has always resonated with me&quot; she said. She &quot;knew that she was going to spend her life performing&quot; after seeing a performance of the musical The Secret Garden on Broadway at the age of six. &quot;So I thought that was it. I was going to be Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden.&quot;\n\nWhen she was 15, however, she became a member of the Orlando, Florida all-girl mainstream pop group Bella. The group's touring performances included singing and dancing, which were &quot;two things I loved&quot;, she said. After the group disbanded, Battistelli picked up the guitar and began writing songs.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba846a957b7995a035aa8801d46f06b2196a046","amp;dn":"Francesca+Battistelli+-+Beautiful%2C+Beautiful+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba846a957b7995a035aa8801d46f06b2196a046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,168,70,169,87,183,153,90,3,90,168,128,29,70,240,107,33,150,160,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
