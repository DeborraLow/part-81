There is a lot of recycling of gags taking place in Arthur's house![/quote]\n\nCast:\nArthur Smith\nPippa Evans\n\n\nGuests include \nPaul Sinha\nMilton Jones\nGlenn Tilbrook\nBenjamin Zephaniah\nStephen K Amos\nMatt Holness\nNat Luurtsema\nSeann Walsh\nStewart Lee\nReginald D Hunter\nSophie Eillis Bexter\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/arthur_smiths_balham_bash/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/arthur_smiths_balham_bash/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nArthur Smith's Balham Bash - S01 - E01\nArthur Smith's Balham Bash - S01 - E02\nArthur Smith's Balham Bash - S01 - E03\nArthur Smith's Balham Bash - S01 - E04\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 31s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n \n\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a846c7683dacd5acda5f821916878bc57bb61c6f","amp;dn":"Arthur+Smiths+Balham+Bash+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a846c7683dacd5acda5f821916878bc57bb61c6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,70,199,104,61,172,213,172,218,95,130,25,22,135,139,197,123,182,28,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
