PGI Fortran Workstation provides the\nfeatures, quality, and reliability necessary for developing\nand maintaining advanced scientific and technical\napplications.\n\nPGI C/C Workstation includes The Portland Group's native\nparallelizing/optimizing OpenMP C and ANSI C compilers.\nThe C compiler closely tracks the proposed ANSI standard\nand is compatible with cfront versions 2 and 3. All C\nfunctions are compatible with Fortran and C functions, so\nyou can compose programs from components written in all\nthree languages.\n\nPGI Workstation includes the OpenMP and MPI enabled PGDBG\nparallel debugger and PGPROF performance profiler that can\ndebug and profile up to eight local MPI processes. PGI\nWorkstation also includes several versions of precompiled\nMPICH message passing libraries.\n\nPGI Workstation includes a single user node-locked license\nfor Linux, Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows.
