He played in clubs and bars, and recorded on independent record labels in Texas, with a constantly changing line-up, during the early 1960s. The only constant band members were Fuller himself (on vocals and guitar), and his younger brother, Randy Fuller (born on January 29, 1944, in Hobbs, New Mexico) on bass. Most of these independent releases (except two songs that were recorded at the studio of Norman Petty in Clovis), and an excursion to Yucca Records, also in New Mexico, were recorded in the Fullers' own home-cum-studio, with Fuller acting as the producer. He even built a primitive echo chamber in the backyard. The quality of the recordings, using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station, was so impressive that he even offered the use of his 'studio' to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills.\nFuller moved to Los Angeles in 1964 with his band The Bobby Fuller Four, and was signed to Mustang Records by producer Bob Keane, who was noted for discovering Ritchie Valens and producing many surf music groups. By this time, group consisted of Bobby and brother Randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively, Jim Reese on guitar and DeWayne Quirico (later replaced by Dalton Powell) on drums.\nMovies: &quot;The Bobby Fuller Four,&quot; appear in the movie, &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini,&quot; 1966. In this movie they apparently back-up Nancy Sinatra for the song, &quot;Geronimo,&quot; and continue to play for the pool party scene. &lt;/see end credits and Wikipedia listing of movie&gt;\nAt a time when the British Invasion and folk rock were the dominant genres in rock, Fuller stuck to Buddy Holly's style of classic rock and roll with Tex Mex flourishes. His recordings reveal the influence of Eddie Cochran, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and the Everly Brothers in cover recordings and original compositions, as well as instrumental surf guitar. Less well known was Fuller's ability to emulate the reverb-laden surf guitar sounds of Dick Dale and the Ventures. His first Top 40 hit was &quot;Let Her Dance,&quot; written by Bobby Fuller. His second hit, &quot;I Fought the Law,&quot; hit #8 on Billboard. It was written by Sonny Curtis, a former member of Holly's group The Crickets, and recorded by the line-up of the Fuller brothers, James Reese on guitar, and Dalton Powell on drums. His third Top 40 hit was the Buddy Holly cover song &quot;Love's Made a Fool of You. \n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d03286f0b02b307266efc56f135a050c15d19698","amp;dn":"The+Bobby+Fuller+Four-6+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d03286f0b02b307266efc56f135a050c15d19698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,50,134,240,176,43,48,114,102,239,197,111,19,90,5,12,21,209,150,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
