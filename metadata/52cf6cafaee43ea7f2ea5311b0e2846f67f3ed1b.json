Still, no matter where he travels, home is truly where the\nheart is for this Brooklyn native, which is why he has created a musical\nscrapbook of his life entitled The Triborough Odyssey. But make no mistake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nalthough each song on the album was inspired by specific events and places that\nbind New Yorkers, all of the emotions on the record are universal. Like BonzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ndebut album, From Sumi to Japan, The Triborough Odyssey is a refreshing\ncompilation of experimental sounds with even more luscious arrangements.\nHowever, it was the likes of the Notorious B.I.G. and Nas who had the biggest\ninfluence on BonzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal for the new album. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sort of inspiring when you\nhear rappers drop the names of neighborhoods or sing about different places and\nyou know what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re talking about,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI wanted to apply that\nupbringing, that surrounding, and write-what-you-know-about aspect to this\nrecord.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAlthough the album pays homage to New York, Bonz and his band, The Major Crimes,\nactually flew out to Chicago to record with John McEntire (Tortoise, The Sea and\nCake) at his legendary Soma Electronic Music Studios. Accustomed to recording in\nhis hometown and fine-tuning the sound in friendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ basements, working with\nMcEntire proved to be nothing short of enlightening. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was a great experience\nto work with John and be put up to the challenge of recording with someone you\ndonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any back story with, and who has a history of records you enjoy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nBonz explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œListening to and hearing stuff back in that control room and\nbeing in the same studio that Wilco recorded some of their records, you sort of\nsit there and say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Oh, this is why weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re working with this guy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ because he\nmakes Stereolab sound like Stereolab.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLyrically, Bonz was inspired by the 2003 Blackout, 9/11, Manhattan real estate\nand more, but each track also touches upon his ever-changing relationships. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe\nHoney Bee,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreamy, doo-wop-inspired first single, is something that\nBonz doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t usually dabble with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a love song. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not really into writing\nabout girls or taking that personal aspect of my life and applying it to a song,\nbut itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about dating someone that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t grow up in New York and moved here,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nhe reveals. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI feel like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always interesting to get asked questions from\npeople that are just discovering the city and re-situating their lives.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAnother unique offering on the record is the acoustic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Corduroy Eye,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which\nis about BonzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend who dealt with sex addiction, and is sung entirely in\nSpanish. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Harlem Hand, A Harlem HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the most noticeable gems on\nthe album, rooted in smooth jazz and focused on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe projects and the people who\nlive there, and how thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slowly being stripped away because of real estate.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBut the true benchmark of the new record is BonzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most personal song,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTriborough,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which features an extended instrumental introduction before\nallowing the cerebral singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals to come in. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about any relationship\nyou have, whether it be something involving love, friendship or a family member,\nand what happens when you get so comfortable with the dynamic that you let your\nguard down,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he muses.\n\nThose wondering about the Dot Hongs can rest assured ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the name has been buried,\nbut nearly all of the players remain the same. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was just a joke that turned\ninto a laughing kind of thing when we would bring it up to people that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\neven know what we sounded like, so we changed our name to Brian Bonz and The\nMajor Crimes, which is inspired by the HBO show The Wire,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a\nWire freak, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not going to get deep into the meaning behind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Major\nCrimes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ People can Wikipedia that.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn the last two years, Bonz has grown tremendously, and like many of the best\nwriters do, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s channeling all of his (still-mounting) life experiences into\nhis music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ only this time around, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doing it New York style. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou write\nabout what you know and what you learned from some of the people that you may\nhave trusted when things are good or bad,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrom that point on, I think\nitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important to retrace whatever the issue is and make sure you take a step\nback and get a good perspective about it all.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Case closed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52cf6cafaee43ea7f2ea5311b0e2846f67f3ed1b","amp;dn":"Brian+Bonz-The+Triborough+Odyssey-2010-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52cf6cafaee43ea7f2ea5311b0e2846f67f3ed1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,207,108,175,174,228,62,167,242,234,83,17,176,226,132,111,103,243,237,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
