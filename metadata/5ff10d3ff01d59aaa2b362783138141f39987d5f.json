This part of the series looks further at the United States and Britain's role in supporting terrorism, with a reinterpretation of the 90s conflict in the Balkans. Like the Soviet/Afghan war, covert operations saw the CIA and British intelligence fund muslim terrorists in Kosovo, this time to fight the serbs, but it was the western world order that would pick up the scraps when the dust settled, not the muslims or the serbs.\n\nMeanwhile on British soil authorities allowed the rise of radical preachers like Omar Bakri and Abu Hamza who would shape the minds of many would be extremists and terrorists under a &quot;covenant of security&quot;. They are inexplicably linked to the modern day divide and rule conflicts between Islam4UK, the EDL and UAF.\n\nHigh Quality\nScreen: 16:9\nFormat: WMV\nBitrate: 1159kb/s\nDuration: 1hour\n\nWebsite: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wideshut.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wideshut.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff10d3ff01d59aaa2b362783138141f39987d5f","amp;dn":"7%2F7+The+Big+Picture+-+London+Bombings+Documentary+-+Disc+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff10d3ff01d59aaa2b362783138141f39987d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,241,13,63,240,29,89,170,162,179,98,120,49,56,20,31,57,152,125,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
