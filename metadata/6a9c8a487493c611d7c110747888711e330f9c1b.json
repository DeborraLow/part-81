House Mix XV - A Tron Legacy Mix (XII-VIII-MMX)\n\n\nHouse Mix XV is finally here!  Sorry for the slight delay however it took me awhile to finish up the mixing process as I'm experimenting with some new software.  I'm really excited about this one as I've included two of my very own remixes for you to check out.  A little tribute to one of my favourite movies as a kid and an ode to the upcoming remake which includes a soundtrack produced by none other than Daft Punk.  Some amazing tracks are here so hold on tight! \n\n\nBe sure to check out tracks by Steve Angello, Koen Groeneveld, Gerd, Rainer Weichhold and my very own remix which closes out this beautiful set.  It's a remix and mash-up of a brand new Daft Punk track  from the Tron Legacy soundtrack.  I hope you like it!\n\nThanks again for all the amazing comments and I'd like to say hello to all my visitors from around the globe who keep this going!
