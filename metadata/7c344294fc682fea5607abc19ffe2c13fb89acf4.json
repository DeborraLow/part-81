The band was formed in 1984 in\nHanover Germany and has been through many lineup changes. This is the\nfirst studio album with their current lead vocalist. Unfortunately, I\ncannot remember if I have ever heard him before, so I canÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell if\nJioti Parcharidis (the new singer) is better or not than Charlie Huhn.\nVICTORY has a traditional Metal sound that harkens back to glory days\nof the 80Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. The band was very popular in Germany and has toured the\nworld extensively. In total, the band has released 10 albums. ItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been\na while since I reviewed such a well established band. I have been\ngetting a lot of unsigned independent bandÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CDs lately. The sound is\nrich and filled with classic Metal guitars and choruses. They sound a\nbit like ACCEPT and have some early SCORPIONS influences as well.\n\nFor some reason the band decided to record the song, Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m So ExcitedÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nby the POINTER SISTERS. Yeah, thatÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right. I have no idea why either.\nHearing a Heavy Metal version of that famous song is simply hilarious.\nThe bad German accented English by a man in his late 50Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing those\nlyrics are just priceless. The funniest part of the song is how\nseriously they play it. This isnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done as a joke. ItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the best\nsong on the album, at least to me it is. The dual guitar solo in the\nsong seals the deal. This simply has to be heard, but alas, it does not\nreach the epic status that is Lemmy Kilmister and Wendy O WIlliams\nsinging Tammy WynetteÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Stand By Your ManÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If you play the first\nsong, Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“RestlessÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ you will think you turned on an ACCEPT album. Only the\nvocals differentiate it from them. ThatÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great band to sound like if\nyou have to sound like someone. At first I thought it was Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Restless And\nWildÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but it is not. This is a band that has been around a long time\nand sounds like they are having fun. You could certainly do worse than\nto buy this CD.\n\nAnother thing that is very obvious is just how stunningly good the\nguitar solos are. Nothing jumps out at me besides sounding like ACCEPT\nthan the guitar solos do. Some are pretty epic and last for minutes.\nThe overall guitar sound packs a punch and the production is well done.\nThe whole album is a professionally done affair as one would expect\nwith a band thatÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been around as long as VICTORY has. The band just\nkeeps on going. Nothing has been able to stop them. They did disband\nfor a while in 1994 before coming back two years later with two new\nmembers. In 2003 they recorded an album with all but one original\nmember. As I said, the band refuses to go away, and after listening to\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Talk ScienceÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, that is a good thing. Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Love Kills LoveÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a\ngreat song and should get some airplay. VICTORY is no stranger to radio\nplay. In the States where I live, true Metal never gets airplay, and if\nthey do, itÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very old band and they only play one or two hit songs\nthat are decades old. Germany is a Heavy Metal haven and thank God for\nthat!\n\nIf you love the old school Metal from Germany and like some sweet\nsounding guitars, you will like this new album. Again, I canÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t vouch\nfor the new singer being better or worse than their first vocalist, but\nhe does a fine job and the guitar solos are just begging you to come\nlisten to them. This is a very good record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c344294fc682fea5607abc19ffe2c13fb89acf4","amp;dn":"Victory-Dont+Talk+Science-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c344294fc682fea5607abc19ffe2c13fb89acf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,52,66,148,252,104,47,234,86,7,171,193,159,254,44,19,251,137,172,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
