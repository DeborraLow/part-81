Both the play and film are a one-man show about former President of the United States Harry S. Truman. Give 'em Hell, Harry! stars James Whitmore and was directed by Steve Binder and Peter H. Hunt.\n\n\nThe title comes from an incident that took place during the 1948 Presidential election campaign. Whilst in Harrisburg, Illinois, Truman delivered a speech attacking the Republicans. During the speech a supporter yelled out &quot;Give 'em Hell, Harry!&quot;. Truman replied, &quot;I don't give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it's Hell.&quot; Subsequently, &quot;Give 'em Hell, Harry!&quot; became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters.\n\n\nThe play previewed in Hershey, PA followed by its official opening at Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC. Its April 17,1975 premiere was hosted by Truman's daughter Margaret and attended by President Ford. The play then went on to a six city tour, during which it was videotaped for film on the stage of the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington, using a live editing process called Theatrovision. James Whitmore was nominated for Best Actor by both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It is only the third film to have its entire credited cast (Whitmore) nominated for an Academy Award, the first two being Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf in 1966 and Sleuth in 1972.\n\n\nAlthough the play has been regularly revived, it did not make its New York debut until July 2008 at St. Luke's Theatre.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223276c0ad7974fd10f7f90cf9c0a565b7ac343a","amp;dn":"Live+Theatre+-+Give+%5C%27em+Hell%2C+Harry%21+VHS+Rip+%28Harry+Truman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223276c0ad7974fd10f7f90cf9c0a565b7ac343a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,50,118,192,173,121,116,253,16,247,249,12,249,192,165,101,183,172,52,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
