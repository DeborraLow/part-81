The pressure for homes, water and food - compounded by high levels of unemployment - has lead to furious conflict between the rival ethnic groups, with around 1300 people killed in gangland violence last year.\n\n\nFile Name .............: Unreported World S21E04 (15 April 2011)[PDTV(XviD)].avi\n\n\nSource: https://thebox.bz/details.php?id=154649\nUpped by:\tgeclipse","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:562a03333dd470de6060f222bc897e94f12295b8","amp;dn":"Unreported+World%7E+Pakistan+Defenders+of+Karachi+2011+04+15+Ch+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"562a03333dd470de6060f222bc897e94f12295b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,42,3,51,61,212,112,222,96,96,242,34,188,137,126,148,241,34,149,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
