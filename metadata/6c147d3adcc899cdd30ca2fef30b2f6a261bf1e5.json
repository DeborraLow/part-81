He has now scattered them across to faraway planets. While this is happening, a nearby space station picks up a distress signal. Tinhead, guardian of the edge of the universe, hears the cries for help and hurries to the rescue.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat different than your typical platformer. There is some exploration required to find the exit or if you want to get health or points. You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.\n\nAlong with health, you have battery power. This affects the amount of grenade balls you can have on the screen. You can find power-ups to make them go back to normal throughout the stage.\n\nLeap, fly, and shoot your way through some of the craziest environments ever in this futuristic journey to free the stars. You'll come up against pesky, spinning Krystals, spooky Saw-Sirs, and plenty of angry boss characters. There are lots of helpful power-ups and unlikely modes of transport, such as batteries, Hyper-Hoppers, and unique Rocket Packs.\n\nThe four massive worlds are comprised of 24 total levels, and hidden bonus areas will give you needed respite from the grueling hunt.\n\nTinhead features:\n*Four worlds\n*24 levels\n*Cool power-ups\n*Wacky vehicles\n*One-player action\n\n[INSTALLATION]: Double-click the setup file to begin.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
