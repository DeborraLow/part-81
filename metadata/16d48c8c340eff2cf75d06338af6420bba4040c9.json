He described a total freeze in any capital investment or job creation, because &quot;no one knows what this Administration is going to do.&quot; He described the consensus of the people with whom he met last month: &quot;We are already in a deep, prolonged Great Depression.&quot;\n\nWhile he chastised the former Bush-Cheney Administration, he emphasized that the Obama team has gone way beyond the disasters of the Bush-Cheney era. &quot;Valerie Jarrett is the designated liaison of the Obama White House to the business community, and all she does is shake them down for campaign money. It is a total disconnect, and there is no way out.&quot; He acknowledged that Lyndon LaRouche had been &quot;way ahead&quot; of everyone else, in clinically diagnosing the Obama disease.\n\nMore can be found at www.larouchepac.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d48c8c340eff2cf75d06338af6420bba4040c9","amp;dn":"Obama%5C%27s+Failed+Personality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d48c8c340eff2cf75d06338af6420bba4040c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,212,140,140,52,14,255,44,247,93,6,51,138,246,66,11,186,64,64,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
