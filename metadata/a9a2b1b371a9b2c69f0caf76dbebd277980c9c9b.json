For the latest bet, Randolph believes they can take a common criminal and make him a successful businessman in the company. The criminal, Billy Ray, is to be given the job and home of Louis, who in turn is set up for crimes he didn't commit, to see if he resorts to crime once he's lost his rich environment and friends. Written by Rob Hartill \n\nLouis Winthorpe III is a successful Philadelphia commodity broker with mansion, manservant and girlfriend to match. Billy Ray Valentine is a hustling beggar. Winthorpe's employers, the elderly Duke brothers, make a bet that by switching the lifestyle of the two Billy Ray will make good and their man will take to a life of crime. Suddenly Louis finds himself uncomprehendingly with no job, no home and only a new acquaintance, glamorous hooker Ophelia, prepared to help him. So at least in one way things could actually be worse.\n\n\nStarring Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a2b1b371a9b2c69f0caf76dbebd277980c9c9b","amp;dn":"Trading+Places","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a2b1b371a9b2c69f0caf76dbebd277980c9c9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,162,177,179,113,169,178,198,159,12,175,118,219,235,210,119,152,12,156,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
