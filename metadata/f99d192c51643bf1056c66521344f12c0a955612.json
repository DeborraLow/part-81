It was decided to use the demo version of &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; on this collection. Although technically not as good as the later version recorded for Sound Affects, the demo has a certain quality that was never captured again. \n\n\nCDs 1 &amp; 2 originally released as Snap!, Polydor SNAP1 (815 537-1), Oct 14, 1983.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99d192c51643bf1056c66521344f12c0a955612","amp;dn":"The+Jam+-+SNAP%21+ONE.nrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99d192c51643bf1056c66521344f12c0a955612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,157,25,44,81,100,59,241,5,108,102,82,19,68,241,44,10,149,86,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
