As the name suggests the symptoms comprise unrelenting and unwanted feelings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“physicalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ arousal in the absence of any psychological or physical stimulus.  However, physical or psychological stimulation can greatly aggravate the symptoms. The vibrations from sitting in a car, using public transport or even having a mobile phone in your pocket can phenomenally exacerbate the symptoms. There is no known cause or cure and current treatments are in their experimental stages at best. \n\n At first it was thought the condition exclusively effected women but men have also come forward with an equivalent problem. The genitals remain engorged with blood, often becoming painful, and no amount of masturbation or sex relieves the symptoms. Any relief is short-lived and arousal returns almost instantly. Naturally, the condition is deeply distressing. Few medical professionals recognize the disorder and this can be largely attributed to the silence of sufferers, the majority being women, who often feel isolated and ashamed by the nature of the condition.\n\n In this documentary Jeannie Allen, the founder of the first PGAD support group, and three other suffers come together to break the silence.\nWARNING: This material is NOT pornographic and contains no explicit images but does contain sexual references and discussions pertaining to mature topics. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34162b754f965a960fbbe7cddb8a589642018bf4","amp;dn":"Extraordinary+Illnesses%3A+100+Orgasms+a+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34162b754f965a960fbbe7cddb8a589642018bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,22,43,117,79,150,90,150,15,187,231,205,219,138,88,150,66,1,139,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
