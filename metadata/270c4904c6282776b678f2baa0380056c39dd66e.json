And whether James Howlett was indeed the\nson of his family mansionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundskeeper is left loose in the air, as\nin the Origin miniseries.\n\n- While it will not be possible to make the black ops team the same as\nin the comic cannon (originally consisting of Logan, Creed, John\nWraith, Silver Fox and Maverick), some improvements have been made to\nthe scenes. Most of the action has been left for continuity reasons,\nexcept for a certain character climbing buildings for no reason, and\nWade's most over the top action.\n\n- Completely remove all plot regarding Logan volunteering for the\nWeapon X program, in the canon it was an abduction/forced drafting by\nthe Canadian government to create their version of the Super Soldier\na.k.a. Captain America.\n\n- Incorporate/replace the deleted/alternate scenes to the movie, I\nhave two of them from the blu ray and all are quite good for the movie\nIMO.\n\n- Fight scene with Gambit tightened, removing the most over the top elements.\n\n- No Silver Fox drugged to fake death, which is better left\nunexplained; she has no mutant powers and also she is not Emma FrostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nsister.\n\n- The bastardized version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeadpoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ AKA Barakapool on the final\nact is still present, but he is now only referred to as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe mutant\nkillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeapon XIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and is isolated from Wade Wilson, who did\nappear during the Team X mission.\n\n- Most (almost all) of the lame attempts at humor are cut out.\n\n- Various small fixes regarding nonsense lines and redundancies.\n\n- Make sure to watch all thru the end credits, Japan epilogue included\nfollowing the current Marvel movie trend.\n\nPlease take the time to rate and review this fanedit at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fanedit.org/12292/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fanedit.org/12292/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270c4904c6282776b678f2baa0380056c39dd66e","amp;dn":"Codename+%3A+Wolverine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270c4904c6282776b678f2baa0380056c39dd66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,12,73,4,198,40,39,118,182,120,242,186,160,56,0,86,195,157,214,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
