They plan to steal thousands of pounds of old banknotes - by stashing them in their knickers and bras. Caroline Quentin leads the pack as Brigit, with Liz (Melanie Hill) and Jackie (Georgia MacKenzie) her partners in crime. Can the unlikely crooks succeed in making the biggest cash withdrawal of their lives?\n\nRecorded on a VHS Tape in December 2001.\n\nThe sound is a bit distorted for the first couple of minutes because of the age of the video tape, but the rest of it is perfect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf5ad50c09bbc13c64f12e5089628770a3c6468","amp;dn":"Hot+Money+%28ITV+2001%29+Caroline+Quentin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf5ad50c09bbc13c64f12e5089628770a3c6468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,245,173,80,192,155,188,19,198,79,18,229,8,150,40,119,10,60,100,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
