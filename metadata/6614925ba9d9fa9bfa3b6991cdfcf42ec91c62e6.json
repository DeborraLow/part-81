At times itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even a bit too much. Some light-funk, brainy R&amp;B, smooth\nYacht rock and warped art-rock all seep into the mix. Even with all those\nsounds, the album is rarely unfocused. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just that sometimes it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sound\nall that appealing.\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitarist, Jason Caddell, is best known for playing with the\nDismemberment Plan, WashingtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beloved indie rockers who embraced spastic funk\nsounds and who staged a successful reunion tour earlier this year. But the Plan\nserves as more of a reference point for PBS rather than a blueprint. Even with\nall the genre-hopping, singer David Brown is the focal point of most of these\nsongs, filling up any empty spaces with wordy forays into awkward seduction.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHotter Than a PoptartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is his idea of a compliment. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe can make a video and\nput it up on YouTube,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he purrs on opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig Chief.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sometimes it makes you\nchuckle, but too often it sounds like the singer from Barenaked Ladies doing a\nbad R. Kelly impression.\n\nPBS is at its strongest when it dials things down. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFool RunninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the best\ncombination of easygoing funk and sprightly guitar and keyboards. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDance AloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nis straightforward blue-eyed soul thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s neither tongue-in-cheek or overly\nsaccharine, allowing listeners to groove without cringing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6614925ba9d9fa9bfa3b6991cdfcf42ec91c62e6","amp;dn":"Poor+But+Sexy-Lets+Move+In+Together-2011-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6614925ba9d9fa9bfa3b6991cdfcf42ec91c62e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,20,146,91,169,217,250,155,250,59,105,145,205,252,244,46,201,28,98,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
