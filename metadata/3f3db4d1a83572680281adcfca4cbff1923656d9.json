Starting on              \n           Halloween and ending around Christmas, it attracts the         \n           sport's best surfers to the legendary North Shore, known       \n           for its huge waves and unparalleled surf. The Triple           \n           Crown is the ultimate proving ground for world class           \n           surfers, but the events also lure amateurs, surfers young      \n           and old, and hopefuls to the North Shore; where                \n           population, tension and commerce swell during the              \n           competition. Real life drama, humor, death-defying waves,      \n           rivalries, parties, heart-break, romance, injuries, and        \n           humanity all collide during the nearly two month               \n           competition on Hawaii's &quot;7 Mile Miracle&quot;. The film will        \n           follow multiple story lines over the course of the entire      \n           competition and will rely upon Dana Brown's unique             \n           ability to take cinematic events and populate them with        \n           heroes and everyday people to construct a moving story.        \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Monique Marrier............ :                                  \n           David Sanderson............ : ....................Himself      \n           Kelly Slater............... : ....................Himself      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
