Their songs are aggressive and hooky, yet the band avoids easy categorization: songs range from hard, funky celebrations of zombiism (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDead But Too Dumb To Lay DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to less-than-moral ways of dealing with failing relationships (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCleaning UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Their shows have been gaining a reputation across Queens for being exhilarating and addictive. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult to describe their sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been described as a mix between the Talking Heads, Dawn of the Dead and Frank Zappa. But there is something unique about these guys. Their sound is fresh, their songs are contagious, and their audiences are getting bigger with every show.\n\nIf you enjoy this album, please help seed it!
