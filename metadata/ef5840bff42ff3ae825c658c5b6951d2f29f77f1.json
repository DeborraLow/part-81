The cemetery office contains two significant things. A groundskeeper of \n40 some years who the board is &quot;encouraging&quot; to retire, and a huge map of the \ncemetery, complete with white pins for pre-purchased, but unoccupied plots and \nblack pins for occupied or soon-to-be-occupied plots. On Kraft's first day at the \ncemetery, a young couple arrives and purchases plots. Kraft accidentally places \nblack pins instead of white to mark their plots on the map, and a day later, the \nyoung couple is dead -- they were victims in an automobile crash.\n\nHe doesn't notice this until he returns the next day, and it immediately spooks him. \nOn a whim, he places a black pin randomly in the map, and as you might guess, the \nperson who the plot belonged to ends up dead--of natural causes.\n\nAlready, that would probably seem a bit too much of a further coincidence to justify \ncontinuing to experiment with black pins, but absurd as it is -- and this is one of \nthe things that remarkably make I Bury the Living work as a quirky, enjoyable film \n-- Kraft makes no secret of the mysterious occurrences, going so far as completely \nfilling in the police and a reporter friend, and everyone around him encourages him \nto keep trying the black pins, because &quot;surely with such-and-such combination&quot; it will \nbe clear to you that these incidents are coincidence.\n\nBand masterfully creates suspense out of this situation that could have easily turned \ninto a comedy given that plot decision. A more stereotypical choice might have been to \nturn Kraft into a madman, abusing his newfound power. Band takes a more interesting road, \ncreating a fine, atmospheric mystery/thriller, complete with a few, choice, subtle but \nimpressive visual effects for 1958. Also notable visually is the cemetery map itself \n(and the pins) . . . that simple, but interestingly non-symmetrical image \n(especially the graceful and unusually curving road) has already been burned into my memory, \nand I suspect it will remain there for some time to come.\n\nStill, in retrospect, I Bury the Living is a bit thin and seems more like a made for TV \nfilm than a major theatrical release. Marketed as horror -- at least presently -- it \nreally has little to do with that genre in any more than a very superficial aspect --even \nthough horror is hinted at.\n\nAlso, I Bury the Living is definitely a slower-paced, black and white film focusing mostly \non dialogue. Any fans without a taste for that should stay away from I Bury the Living. But \nfans with a taste for films of the era, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; fans, and even fans of noirish \ndetective films, as well as those interested in seeing some of the work of Charles Band's \nfather, should not hesitate in giving this film a chance.\n\n--------------- SCREENSHOTS ---------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33239.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33239.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33240.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33240.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33241.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33241.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33242.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33242.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33243.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33243.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33244.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33244.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33245.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33245.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n   General\n      \n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 273 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n\n   Video \n      \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 1 152 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.156\n      Stream size : 633 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n\n   Audio \n      \n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 112 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 61.6 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n\n   Source\n \n       Region One DVD(NTSC) 720 x 480 29.970 fps 1.33:1 (4:3)\n       B&amp;W AC3 Dolby 2CH Stereo 192 Kb/s 48.0 KHz\n\n\n   Encode Note\n\n      The pixelation on this video is identicle to what is found\n      on the DVD source.
