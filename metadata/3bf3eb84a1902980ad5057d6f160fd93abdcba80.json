The Polity encompasses many classic science fiction tropes including world-ruling artificial intelligences, androids, hive minds, aliens and time travel. His novels are characterized by fast paced action and violent encounters. While his work is frequently epic in scope and thus nominally space opera, its graphic and aggressive tone is more akin to cyberpunk. When combined with the way that Asher's main characters are usually acting to preserve social order or improve their society (rather than disrupt a society they are estranged from), these influences could place his work in the subgenre known as postcyberpunk.\n\n===============\n\n\nPolity universe\n\n[PDF/MOBI/LRF/LIT/EPUB]\n\nAgent Cormac series:\n\n    Gridlinked\n    The Line of Polity\n    Brass Man\n    Polity Agent\n    Line War\n\nSpatterjay series:\n\n    The Skinner\n    The Voyage of the Sable Keech\n    Orbus\n\nStand alone Polity novels:\n\n    Prador Moon\n    Hilldiggers\n    Shadow of the Scorpion\n    The Technician\n\n\nShort Stories \n\n[PDF]\n\n    Black Rat\n    Check Elastic Before Jumping\n    Proctors\n    Sea of Death\n    Snow in the Desert\n    Sucker\n    The Gabble and Other Stories\n    The Owner\n    The Strood\n    The Veteran\n    Tiger Tiger\n    Watchcrab\n\n\nSingle Novels\n\n[PDF/MOBI/LRF/LIT/EPUB]\n\n    The Cowl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf3eb84a1902980ad5057d6f160fd93abdcba80","amp;dn":"Neal+Asher+-+Polity+Universe+and+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bf3eb84a1902980ad5057d6f160fd93abdcba80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,243,235,132,161,144,41,128,173,80,87,214,241,96,253,147,171,220,186,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
