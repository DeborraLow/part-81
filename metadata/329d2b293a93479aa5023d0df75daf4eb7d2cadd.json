You do not pay any licensing fees. You can download, use and share Alpine Linux with anyone for absolutely nothing.\nAlpine Linux was designed with security in mind. It has proactive security features, such as PaX and SSP, that prevent security holes from being exploited.\nAlpine Linux uses the uClibc C library and all of the base tools from BusyBox. These are normally found on embedded systems and are smaller than the tools found on GNU/Linux systems. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://alpinelinux.org/wiki/About&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://alpinelinux.org/wiki/About&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 820eba9e5d4998fd4a116af5056d6fbe748ff5ba  alpine-2.0.0-x86.iso\nsha1sum : 34b4cb379add84ea8c0da4efd60f48166b368618  alpine-mini-2.0.0-x86.iso\nsha1sum : dc81094840dc8853bbad93c95f744b63a538c0a8  alpine-vserver-2.0.0-x86.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329d2b293a93479aa5023d0df75daf4eb7d2cadd","amp;dn":"alpine-2.0.0-x86.iso+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329d2b293a93479aa5023d0df75daf4eb7d2cadd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,157,43,41,58,147,71,154,165,2,61,13,247,93,175,78,183,210,202,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
