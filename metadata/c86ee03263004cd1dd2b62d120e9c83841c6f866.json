Well, 11, since your putter, sand wedge and 5-iron are mandatory. \n\nGo to your club tuner and note the rated distance at 100% power for each club. If the chart does not rise smoothly, that means you will need to work a bit on the tuning. If the chart is smooth, then you can decide which clubs to pick. \n\nIf you are still stuck you can check out the official forum at http://forums.xbox.com/2721/ShowForum.aspx , there's always somebody willing to lend a hand, and many of the players do play golf in real life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86ee03263004cd1dd2b62d120e9c83841c6f866","amp;dn":"Golf+Club+spreadsheet+for+Tiger+Woods+PGA+Tour+12%3A+The+Masters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86ee03263004cd1dd2b62d120e9c83841c6f866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,110,224,50,99,0,76,209,221,43,98,209,32,233,200,56,65,198,248,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
