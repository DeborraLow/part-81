The show was created by Dave Erickson and executive produced by Denis Leary, Jim Serpico, Walon Green, John Kane, and Mike Figgis, who also directed the pilot. The series revolved around Elizabeth Canterbury (portrayed by Julianna Margulies), a rebellious defense attorney willing to bend the law if it protects the wrongfully accused. A rising star, she puts her career on the line to take on risky and unpopular cases, even when they take a toll on her personal life.\n\nProduced by Sony Pictures Television and Apostle, the series aired Mondays at 9/8c and was broadcast in Australia and Canada on Channel Nine and Global respectively.

Repeats of House assumed the series\\' original Monday timeslot.[3]\n\nOn May 15, 2008, Fox officially canceled the series.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlot\n\nElizabeth and her law professor husband, Matthew (Aidan Quinn), are both haunted by the disappearance of their young son (Jeremy Zorek) and have just settled in Providence, Rhode Island, in an attempt to distance themselves from the tragedy and put their relationship back together. But even as they try to move on beyond the tragedy, those goals become elusive whenever Elizabeth\\'s work provides a stark reminder of the justice absent in their own lives.\n\nAt work, Elizabeth must also deal with fellow coworkers: associates Russell Krauss (Ben Shenkman), a former district attorney, who was forced out of his job by his financially-strapped boss and whose knowledge will guide Elizabeth in their cases, even if she doesn\\'t want to hear his reasoning or logic; Chester Fields (Keith Robinson), a congressman\\'s son who wants to distance himself from his political family; and Molly McConnell (Trieste Dunn), a headstrong individual who\\'s not afraid to switch sides, even if it\\'s against Elizabeth.\n\nFrank Angstrom (Rescue Me\\'s James McCaffrey) is a private investigator with whom Elizabeth has a sometime affair.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                  Cast\nPrincipal characters\n\n    * Julianna Margulies (Elizabeth Canterbury)\n    * Ben Shenkman (Russell Krauss)\n    * Trieste Dunn (Molly McConnell)\n    * Keith Robinson (Chester Fields)\n    * Terry Kinney (Deputy Attorney General Zach Williams)\n    * Aidan Quinn (Matthew \\&quot;Matt\\&quot; Furey)\n    * James McCaffrey (Frank Angstrom)\n\nRecurring characters\n\n    * David Call (Martin, the receptionist)\n\nJocko Sims was originally cast as Chester Fields but the role was re-cast in June 2007.[6] Linus Roache was also replaced by Aidan Quinn in August 2007 after the former landed a regular starring role in Law &amp; Order.
