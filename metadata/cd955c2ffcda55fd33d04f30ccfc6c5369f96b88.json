But it's the ballad cuts that really make this CD so special and appealing, where Karen Lovely throws the glove down and shows us her tender and emotional side. The title tune, Still The Rain, is absolutely dark, emotional, and foreboding, while Karen will make you shiver as her voice drips with sadness on Other Plans accompanied by Vannice's haunting tenor. Veteran Producer Dennis Walker has definitely brought out the best in Karen Lovely on Still The Rain.\n\nTracklist\n1. Blues Ain't Far Behind 3:47\n2. Sunny Weather 4:11\n3. Still the Rain 5:11\n4.
