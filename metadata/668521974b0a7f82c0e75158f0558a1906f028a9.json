Unsure of their newest recruit, the Guardians assign Hal to their most-honoured Green Lantern Sinestro for training, unaware that Sinestro wants to overthrow the Guardians and create a new order he'll control. It's a battle of might and willpower as Hal must prove his worth by defeating Sinestro to save the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nVoiced by a stellar cast including Christoper Meloni, Victor Garber, Tricia Helfer and Michael Madsen, this DC Universe original animated adverts bursts with action-packed shakedowns, showdowns and spectacular visuals as Green Lantern uses his powers and imagination to make the impossible real.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:668521974b0a7f82c0e75158f0558a1906f028a9","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+First+Flight+2009+DVDRIP+XVID-Winker%40kidzcorner-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"668521974b0a7f82c0e75158f0558a1906f028a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,133,33,151,75,10,127,130,192,231,81,88,240,85,138,25,6,240,40,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
