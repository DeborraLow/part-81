Portland Terminal is based in the historic and picturesque city of Portland, Maine. From 1911 it was run by the Portland Terminal Company which handled switching duties for the Maine Central and Boston &amp; Maine railroads, until 1981 when all three railroads were acquired by Guilford Transportation Systems. This company still operates in this area today under the name Pan-Am Railways. The Portland Terminal Expansion Pack, developed by G-Trax, includes elements and locomotives from each of these eras, enabling you to operate the line with Maine Central and Boston &amp; Maine locomotives as in the old days, or with more recent Guilford or Pan-Am liveried locomotives. The route takes you down the main street alongside the harbor in amongst the road traffic and pedestrians, through Union Station and on to Rigby Yard where the old turntable and roundhouse (now demolished in real life) are fully operational, with numerous spurs serving industrial facilities and the port.
