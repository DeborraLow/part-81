It is often considered to be, along with The Three Musketeers, Dumas' most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.\n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through to the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness and is told in the style of an adventure story.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCast:\nAndrew Sachs\nGeoffrey Matthews\nNigel Anthony\nPaul Gregory\nMelinda Walker\nSteve Hodson\nLeslie Sands.\n\n\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 01 of 07 - Betrayal\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 02 of 07 - The Chateau d'If\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 03 of 07 - The Abbe Faria\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 04 of 07 - Escape\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 05 of 07 - The Dinner Party\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 06 of 07 - Poison\nThe Count Of Monte Cristo - 07 of 07 - The Enquiry\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 56mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1768a098b09cf7df156c4263b052f036433b49a","amp;dn":"Alexandre+Dumas+-+The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1768a098b09cf7df156c4263b052f036433b49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,118,138,9,139,9,207,125,241,86,196,38,59,5,47,3,100,51,180,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
