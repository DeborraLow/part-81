BetterZip can open and extract archives \n  with the most common formats: ZIP, SIT, TAR, XAR, GZip, BZip2, \n  RAR, 7-Zip, CPIO, ARJ, LZH/LHA, JAR, WAR, CAB, ISO, CHM,\n   RPM, DEB, NSIS, BIN, HQX.\n\n* Create Archives: Simply drag files and folders from your hard drives, \n  disks, or network places into your new zip file. You no longer have to \n  copy all the files into a temporary folder first. The supported formats are      \n  ZIP, TAR, GZip and BZip2 compressed TAR, XAR, 7-ZIP, and RAR \n  (using the external RAR commandline tool). Large archives can also be \n  split.\n\n* Protect Your Data: BetterZip can protect your data with a password and\n   create WinZip compatible AES-256 encrypted archives. 7-zip and rar \n  archives can also be protected.\n\n* Update Archives: Add new or updated files to existing archives. \n  Remove any file or folder from an archive, or even move files around \n  inside the archive as if it were a normal folder.\n\n* Make Archives Compatible: Strip Mac specific files and resource forks \n  from archives for best compatibility with systems like Windows or \n  Linux.\n\nWhat's New\n\nVersion 2.0.1:\n\n* Fixed extraction for SIT archives.\n\n* Fixed the selection of service and default presets.\n\n* Fixed correct execution of some post-extraction options (revealing the \n  extracted files in Finder, removing the archive, ...)\n\n* Fixed a potential security problem.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c45f86a075759ec8a30cd2c25683c87d67b034","amp;dn":"BetterZip+v+2.0.1+Intel+and+pre%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c45f86a075759ec8a30cd2c25683c87d67b034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,196,95,134,160,117,117,158,200,163,12,210,194,86,131,200,125,103,176,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
