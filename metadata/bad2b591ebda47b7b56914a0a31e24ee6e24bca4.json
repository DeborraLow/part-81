It was recorded in Los Angeles and Sweden. On 16 November 2009 the album debuted at #7 on the ARIA Albums Chart.\n\nShe had shelved another record she had written to follow up Somewhere in the Real World. The record wasn't good enough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ she would start again. So on her way home from songwriting sessions, she stopped off in Sweden at the suggestion of her publishers. The connection between her and the MachoPsycho team was instant. &quot;It was literally pouring out of us. It's such a crazy thing when you have the right magic and chemistry going on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the songs tend to write themselves and really quickly,&quot; Amorosi says.\n\n&quot;This album is so raw and edgy and out-there... it might scare people whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve bought my albums in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;The whole album is all the stuff IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never wanted to talk about, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve only now had the courage to put it out there. I had a lot to say with this album, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why it came so quickly. I think a lot of people thought IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d take my time again, which I was nervous about. We were going to head to Europe with the last album, but then it wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been another two years, and people wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve thought ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m tired of buying her records, she pisses off after each oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.&quot;\n\n1. &quot;This Is Who I Am&quot;   Vanessa Amorosi, MachoPsycho (Robin Lynch &amp; Niklas Olovson) 3:25 \n2. &quot;Mr. Mysterious&quot; (rap by Seany B) Amorosi, MachoPsycho 4:00 \n3. &quot;Holiday&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:17 \n4. &quot;Hazardous&quot;   Amorosi, Stefanie Ridel, Stuart Crichton, T James 3:26 \n5. &quot;Off on My Kiss&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:31 \n6. &quot;Show Me How to Love&quot;   Amorosi, Pam Reswick 4:04 \n7. &quot;Aliens &amp; U.F.O.s&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:15 \n8. &quot;Summer Nights&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 2:53 \n9. &quot;Touch Me&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:05 \n10. &quot;Baby's on Ice&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:32 \n11. &quot;Sleep with That&quot;   Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:26 \n12. &quot;Higher Ground&quot;   Amorosi, Reswick 3:50 \n13. &quot;Blow Me Away&quot;   Amorosi, Matthew Gerrard, Steve Diamond 3:32 \n14. &quot;Snitch&quot; (featuring Vince Colosimo) Amorosi, MachoPsycho 3:27 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad2b591ebda47b7b56914a0a31e24ee6e24bca4","amp;dn":"Vanessa+Amorosi+-+Hazardous+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad2b591ebda47b7b56914a0a31e24ee6e24bca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,210,181,145,235,218,71,183,181,105,20,160,163,30,36,238,110,36,188,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
